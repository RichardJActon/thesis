abstract = {Poor research design and data analysis encourage false-positive findings. Such poor methods persist despite perennial calls for improvement, suggesting that they result from something more than just misunderstanding. The persistence of poor methods results partly from incentives that favour them, leading to the natural selection of bad science. This dynamic requires no conscious strategizing—no deliberate cheating nor loafing— by scientists, only that publication is a principal factor for career advancement. Some normative methods of analysis have almost certainly been selected to further publication instead of discovery. In order to improve the culture of science, a shift must be made away from correcting misunderstandings and towards rewarding understanding. We support this argument with empirical evidence and computational modelling. We first present a 60-year meta-analysis of statistical power in the behavioural sciences and show that power has not improved despite repeated demonstrations of the necessity of increasing power. To demonstrate the logical consequences of structural incentives, we then present a dynamic model of scientific communities in which competing laboratories investigate novel or previously published hypotheses using culturally transmitted research methods. As in the real world, successful labs produce more ‘progeny,' such that their methods are more often copied and their students are more likely to start labs of their own. Selection for high output leads to poorer methods and increasingly high false discovery rates. We additionally show that replication slows but does not stop the process of methodological deterioration. Improving the quality of research requires change at the institutional level.},

abstract = {Migration and invasion enhancer 1 (MIEN1) is a novel gene involved in prostate cancer progression by enhancing prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. DNA methylation, an important epigenetic regulation, is one of the most widely altered mechanisms in prostate cancer. This phenomenon frames the basis to study the DNA methylation patterns in the promoter region of MIEN1. Bisulfite pyrosequencing demonstrates the MIEN1 promoter contains a short interspersed nuclear Alu element (SINE Alu) repeat sequence. Validation of methylation inhibition on MIEN1 was performed using nucleoside analogs and non-nucleoside inhibitors and resulted in an increase in both MIEN1 RNA and protein in normal cells. MIEN1 mRNA and protein increases upon inhibition of individual DNA methyltransferases using RNA interference technologies. Furthermore, dual luciferase reporter assays, in silico analysis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays identified a sequence upstream of the transcription start site that has a site for binding of the USF transcription factors. These results suggest the MIEN1 promoter has a SINE Alu region that is hypermethylated in normal cells leading to repression of the gene. In cancer, the hypomethylation of a part of this repeat, in addition to the binding of USF, results in MIEN1 expression.},

abstract = {Until recently the study of individual DNA sequences and of total DNA content (the C-value) sat at opposite ends of the spectrum in genome biology. For gene sequencers, the vast stretches of non-coding DNA found in eukaryotic genomes were largely considered to be an annoyance, whereas genome-size researchers attributed little relevance to specific nucleotide sequences. However, the dawn of comprehensive genome sequencing has allowed a new synergy between these fields, with sequence data providing novel insights into genome-size evolution, and with genome-size data being of both practical and theoretical significance for large-scale sequence analysis. In combination, these formerly disconnected disciplines are poised to deliver a greatly improved understanding of genome structure and evolution.},

abstract = {Recent evidence supports a role for microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulating the life span of model organisms. However, little is known about how these small RNAs contribute to human aging. Here, we profiled the expression of over 800 miRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from young and old individuals by real-time RT-PCR analysis. This genome-wide assessment of miRNA expression revealed that the majority of miRNAs studied decreased in abundance with age. We identified nine miRNAs (miR-103, miR-107, miR-128, miR-130a, miR-155, miR-24, miR-221, miR-496, miR-1538) that were significantly lower in older individuals. Among them, five have been implicated in cancer pathogenesis. Predicted targets of several of these miRNAs, including PI3 kinase (PI3K), c-Kit and H2AX, were found to be elevated with advancing age, supporting a possible role for them in the aging process. Furthermore, we found that decreasing the levels of miR-221 was sufficient to cause a corresponding increase in the expression of the predicted target, PI3K. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that changes in miRNA expression occur with human aging and suggest that miRNAs and their predicted targets have the potential to be diagnostic indicators of age or age-related diseases.},

abstract = {Most of today's scientific research relies on computers and software for processing scientific information. Examples of such computer-aided research are the analysis of experimental data or the simulation of phenomena based on theoretical models. With the rapid increase of computational power, scientific software has integrated more and more complex scientific knowledge in a black-box fashion. As a consequence, its users do not know, and do not even have a chance of finding out, which assumptions and approximations their computations are based on. This black-box nature of scientific software has made the verification of much computer-aided research close to impossible. The present work starts with an analysis of this situation from the point of view of human-computer interaction in scientific research. It identifies the key role of digital scientific notations at the human-computer interface, reviews the most popular ones in use today, and describes a proof-of-concept implementation of Leibniz, a language designed as a verifiable digital scientific notation for models formulated as mathematical equations.},

abstract = {Epigenome-wide DNA methylation association studies have identified highly replicable genomic loci sensitive to maternal smoking during gestation. The role of inter-individual genetic variation in influencing DNA methylation, leading to the possibility of confounding or bias of such associations, has not been assessed. We investigated whether the DNA methylation levels at the top ten CpG sites previously associated with exposure to maternal smoking during gestation were associated with individual genetic variation at the genome-wide level. Genome-wide association tests between DNA methylation at the top ten candidate CpG and genome-wide SNPs were performed in 736 case and control participants of the California Childhood Leukemia Study. Three of the strongest maternal-smoking sensitive CpG sites in newborns were significantly associated with SNPs located proximal to each gene: cg18146737 in the GFI1 gene with rs141819830 (P = 8.2×10(-44)), cg05575921 in the AHRR gene with rs148405299 (P = 5.3×10(-10)), and cg12803068 in the MYO1G gene with rs61087368 (P = 1.3×10(-18)). For the GFI1 CpG cg18146737, the underlying genetic variation at rs141819830 confounded the association between maternal smoking and DNA methylation in our data [OR changed from 0.89 (0.75-1.06, P = 0.184) to 0.78 (0.63-0.97, P = 0.024) after including the genotype]. Our results suggest that further studies using DNA methylation at cg18146737, cg05575921, or cg12803068 that aim to assess exposure to maternal smoking during gestation should include genotype at the corresponding SNP. New methods are required for adequate and routine inclusion of genotypic influence on DNA methylation in epigenome-wide association studies to control for potential confounding.},

abstract = {We have developed a high-throughput method for analyzing the methylation status of hundreds of preselected genes simultaneously and have applied it to the discovery of methylation signatures that distinguish normal from cancer tissue samples. Through an adaptation of the GoldenGate genotyping assay implemented on a BeadArray platform, the methylation state of 1536 specific CpG sites in 371 genes (one to nine CpG sites per gene) was measured in a single reaction by multiplexed genotyping of 200 ng of bisulfite-treated genomic DNA. The assay was used to obtain a quantitative measure of the methylation level at each CpG site. After validating the assay in cell lines and normal tissues, we analyzed a panel of lung cancer biopsy samples (N = 22) and identified a panel of methylation markers that distinguished lung adenocarcinomas from normal lung tissues with high specificity. These markers were validated in a second sample set (N = 24). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for reliably profiling many CpG sites in parallel for the discovery of informative methylation markers. The technology should prove useful for DNA methylation analyses in large populations, with potential application to the classification and diagnosis of a broad range of cancers and other diseases.},

abstract = {Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are primarily viewed as static contributors to gene expression. By developing a high-throughput tRNA profiling method, we find that specific tRNAs are upregulated in human breast cancer cells as they gain metastatic activity. Through loss-of-function, gain-of-function, and clinical-association studies, we implicate tRNAGluUUC and tRNAArgCCG as promoters of breast cancer metastasis. Upregulation of these tRNAs enhances stability and ribosome occupancy of transcripts enriched for their cognate codons. Specifically, tRNAGluUUC promotes metastatic progression by directly enhancing EXOSC2 expression and enhancing GRIPAP1 - constituting an "inducible" pathway driven by a tRNA. The cellular proteomic shift toward a pro-metastatic state mirrors global tRNA shifts, allowing for cell-state and cell-type transgene expression optimization through codon content quantification. TRNA modulation represents a mechanism by which cells achieve altered expression of specific transcripts and proteins. TRNAs are thus dynamic regulators of gene expression and the tRNA codon landscape can causally and specifically impact disease progression.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND DNA methylation levels change with age. Recent studies have identified biomarkers of chronological age based on DNA methylation levels. It is not yet known whether DNA methylation age captures aspects of biological age. RESULTS Here we test whether differences between people's chronological ages and estimated ages, DNA methylation age, predict all-cause mortality in later life. The difference between DNA methylation age and chronological age ($\Delta$age) was calculated in four longitudinal cohorts of older people. Meta-analysis of proportional hazards models from the four cohorts was used to determine the association between $\Delta$age and mortality. A 5-year higher $\Delta$age is associated with a 21{\%} higher mortality risk, adjusting for age and sex. After further adjustments for childhood IQ, education, social class, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and APOE e4 status, there is a 16{\%} increased mortality risk for those with a 5-year higher $\Delta$age. A pedigree-based heritability analysis of $\Delta$age was conducted in a separate cohort. The heritability of $\Delta$age was 0.43. CONCLUSIONS DNA methylation-derived measures of accelerated aging are heritable traits that predict mortality independently of health status, lifestyle factors, and known genetic factors.},

abstract = {The chlamydial inclusion membrane is extensively modified by the insertion of type III secreted effector proteins. These inclusion membrane proteins (Incs) are exposed to the cytosol and share a common structural feature of a long, bi-lobed hydrophobic domain but little or no primary amino acid sequence similarity. Based upon secondary structural predictions, over 50 putative inclusion membrane proteins have been identified in Chlamydia trachomatis. Only a limited number of biological functions have been defined and these are not shared between chlamydial species. Here we have ectopically expressed several C. trachomatis Incs in HeLa cells and find that they induce the formation of morphologically distinct membranous vesicular compartments. Formation of these vesicles requires the bi-lobed hydrophobic domain as a minimum. No markers for various cellular organelles were observed in association with these vesicles. Lipid probes were incorporated by the Inc-induced vesicles although the lipids incorporated were dependent upon the specific Inc expressed. Co-expression of Inc pairs indicated that some colocalized in the same vesicle, others partially overlapped, and others did not associate at all. Overall, it appears that Incs may have an intrinsic ability to induce membrane formation and that individual Incs can induce membranous structures with unique properties.},

abstract = {The complex relationship between DNA methylation, chromatin modification, and underlying DNA sequence is often difficult to unravel with existing technologies. Here, we describe a novel technique based on high-throughput sequencing of bisulfite-treated chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA (BisChIP-seq), which can directly interrogate genetic and epigenetic processes that occur in normal and diseased cells. Unlike most previous reports based on correlative techniques, we found using direct bisulfite sequencing of Polycomb H3K27me3-enriched DNA from normal and prostate cancer cells that DNA methylation and H3K27me3-marked histones are not always mutually exclusive, but can co-occur in a genomic region-dependent manner. Notably, in cancer, the co-dependency of marks is largely redistributed with an increase of the dual repressive marks at CpG islands and transcription start sites of silent genes. In contrast, there is a loss of DNA methylation in intergenic H3K27me3-marked regions. Allele-specific methylation status derived from the BisChIP-seq data clearly showed that both methylated and unmethylated alleles can simultaneously be associated with H3K27me3 histones, highlighting that DNA methylation status in these regions is not dependent on Polycomb chromatin status. BisChIP-seq is a novel approach that can be widely applied to directly interrogate the genomic relationship between allele-specific DNA methylation, histone modification, or other important epigenetic regulators.},

abstract = {Genomic analysis of longevity offers the potential to illuminate the biology of human aging. Here, using genome-wide association meta-analysis of 606,059 parents' survival, we discover two regions associated with longevity (HLA-DQA1/DRB1 and LPA). We also validate previous suggestions that APOE, CHRNA3/5, CDKN2A/B, SH2B3 and FOXO3A influence longevity. Next we show that giving up smoking, educational attainment, openness to new experience and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels are most positively genetically correlated with lifespan while susceptibility to coronary artery disease (CAD), cigarettes smoked per day, lung cancer, insulin resistance and body fat are most negatively correlated. We suggest that the effect of education on lifespan is principally mediated through smoking while the effect of obesity appears to act via CAD. Using instrumental variables, we suggest that an increase of one body mass index unit reduces lifespan by 7 months while 1 year of education adds 11 months to expected lifespan. Variability in human longevity is genetically influenced. Using genetic data of parental lifespan, the authors identify associations at HLA-DQA/DRB1 and LPA and find that genetic variants that increase educational attainment have a positive effect on lifespan whereas increasing BMI negatively affects lifespan.},

abstract = {N6-adenosine methylation is a frequent modification of mRNAs and their precursors, but little is known about the mechanism of the reaction or the function of the modification. To explore these questions, we developed conditions to examine N6-adenosine methylase activity in HeLa cell nuclear extracts. Transfer of the methyl group from S-[3H methyl]-adenosylmethionine to unlabeled random co-polymer RNA substrates of varying ribonucleotide composition revealed a substrate specificity consistent with a previously deduced consensus sequence, Pu[G{\textgreater}A]AC[A/C/U]. 32-P labeled RNA substrates of defined sequence were used to examine the minimum sequence requirements for methylation. Each RNA was 20 nucleotldes long, and contained either the core consensus sequence GGACU, or some variation of this sequence. RNAs containing GGACU, either in single or multiple copies, were good substrates for methylation, whereas RNAs containing single base substitutions within the GGACU sequence gave dramatically reduced methylation. These results demonstrate that the N6-adenosine methylase has a strict sequence specificity, and that there is no requirement for extended sequences or secondary structures for methylation. Recognition of this sequence does not require an RNA component, as micrococcal nuclease pretreatment of nuclear extracts actually increased methylation efficiency.},

abstract = {We show that the high in vitro transcription efficiency of yeast RNA pol III is mainly due to rapid recycling. Kinetic analysis shows that RNA polymerase recycling on preassembled tDNA{\textperiodcentered}TFIIIC{\textperiodcentered}TFIIIB complexes is much faster than the initial transcription cycle. High efficiency of RNA pol III recycling is favored at high UTP concentrations and requires termination at the natural termination signal. Runoff transcription does not allow efficient recycling. The reinitiation process shows increased resistance to heparin as compared with the primary initiation cycle, as if RNA polymerase was not released after termination. Indeed, template competition assays show that RNA pol III is committed to reinitiate on the same gene. A model is proposed where the polymerase molecule is directly transferred from the termination site to the promoter.},

abstract = {The predatory bacterium Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus swims rapidly by rotation of a single, polar flagellum comprised of a helical filament of flagellin monomers, contained within a membrane sheath and powered by a basal motor complex. Bdellovibrio collides with, enters and replicates within bacterial prey, a process previously suggested to firstly require flagellar motility and then flagellar shedding upon prey entry. Here we show that flagella are not always shed upon prey entry and we study the six fliC flagellin genes of B. bacteriovorus, finding them all conserved and expressed in genome strain HD100 and the widely studied lab strain 109J. Individual inactivation of five of the fliC genes gave mutant Bdellovibrio that still made flagella, and which were motile and predatory. Inactivation of the sixth fliC gene abolished normal flagellar synthesis and motility, but a disordered flagellar sheath was still seen. We find that this non-motile mutant was still able to predate when directly applied to lawns of YFP-labelled prey bacteria, showing that flagellar motility is not essential for prey entry but important for efficient encounters with prey in liquid environments.},

abstract = {Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a Delta-proteobacterium that oscillates between free-living growth and predation on Gram-negative bacteria including important pathogens of man, animals and plants. After entering the prey periplasm, killing the prey and replicating inside the prey bdelloplast, several motile B. bacteriovorus progeny cells emerge. The B. bacteriovorus HD100 genome encodes numerous proteins predicted to be involved in signalling via the secondary messenger cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP), which is known to affect bacterial lifestyle choices. We investigated the role of c-di-GMP signalling in B. bacteriovorus, focussing on the five GGDEF domain proteins that are predicted to function as diguanylyl cyclases initiating c-di-GMP signalling cascades. Inactivation of individual GGDEF domain genes resulted in remarkably distinct phenotypes. Deletion of dgcB (Bd0742) resulted in a predation impaired, obligately axenic mutant, while deletion of dgcC (Bd1434) resulted in the opposite, obligately predatory mutant. Deletion of dgcA (Bd0367) abolished gliding motility, producing bacteria capable of predatory invasion but unable to leave the exhausted prey. Complementation was achieved with wild type dgc genes, but not with GGAAF versions. Deletion of cdgA (Bd3125) substantially slowed predation; this was restored by wild type complementation. Deletion of dgcD (Bd3766) had no observable phenotype. In vitro assays showed that DgcA, DgcB, and DgcC were diguanylyl cyclases. CdgA lacks enzymatic activity but functions as a c-di-GMP receptor apparently in the DgcB pathway. Activity of DgcD was not detected. Deletion of DgcA strongly decreased the extractable c-di-GMP content of axenic Bdellovibrio cells. We show that c-di-GMP signalling pathways are essential for both the free-living and predatory lifestyles of B. bacteriovorus and that obligately predatory dgcC- can be made lacking a propensity to survive without predation of bacterial pathogens and thus possibly useful in anti-pathogen applications. In contrast to many studies in other bacteria, Bdellovibrio shows specificity and lack of overlap in c-di-GMP signalling pathways.},

abstract = {Many conditions that shift cells from states of nutrient utilization and growth to states of cell maintenance extend lifespan. We have carried out a systematic lifespan analysis of conditions that inhibit protein synthesis. We find that reducing the levels of ribosomal proteins, ribosomal-protein S6 kinase or translation-initiation factors increases the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans. These perturbations, as well as inhibition of the nutrient sensor target of rapamycin (TOR), which is known to increase lifespan, all increase thermal-stress resistance. Thus inhibiting translation may extend lifespan by shifting cells to physiological states that favor maintenance and repair. Interestingly, different types of translation inhibition lead to one of two mutually exclusive outputs, one that increases lifespan and stress resistance through the transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO, and one that increases lifespan and stress resistance independently of DAF-16. Our findings link TOR, but not sir-2.1, to the longevity response induced by dietary restriction (DR) in C. elegans, and they suggest that neither TOR inhibition nor DR extends lifespan simply by reducing protein synthesis.},

the Daf-16/FOXO pathway is downstream of insulin IGF-1 (via the daf-2 receptor) and kinases downstream of daf-2.

DAF-2 mutant longevity is NOT due to decreased global translatio

inhibiting TOR reduces translation - any reduction in translation mimics TOR (extends lifespan in daf-16 but not DAF-2 mutants)

abstract = {BACKGROUND Gestational age is often used as a proxy for developmental maturity by clinicians and researchers alike. DNA methylation has previously been shown to be associated with age and has been used to accurately estimate chronological age in children and adults. In the current study, we examine whether DNA methylation in cord blood can be used to estimate gestational age at birth. RESULTS We find that gestational age can be accurately estimated from DNA methylation of neonatal cord blood and blood spot samples. We calculate a DNA methylation gestational age using 148 CpG sites selected through elastic net regression in six training datasets. We evaluate predictive accuracy in nine testing datasets and find that the accuracy of the DNA methylation gestational age is consistent with that of gestational age estimates based on established methods, such as ultrasound. We also find that an increased DNA methylation gestational age relative to clinical gestational age is associated with birthweight independent of gestational age, sex, and ancestry. CONCLUSIONS DNA methylation can be used to accurately estimate gestational age at or near birth and may provide additional information relevant to developmental stage. Further studies of this predictor are warranted to determine its utility in clinical settings and for research purposes. When clinical estimates are available this measure may increase accuracy in the testing of hypotheses related to developmental age and other early life circumstances.},

We have determined a 1.9 A crystal structure of c-di-GMP bound to VCA0042/PlzD, a PilZ domain-containing protein from Vibrio cholerae. Either this protein or another specific PilZ domain-containing protein is required for V. cholerae to efficiently infect mice. VCA0042/PlzD comprises a C-terminal PilZ domain plus an N-terminal domain with a similar beta-barrel fold. C-di-GMP contacts seven of the nine strongly conserved residues in the PilZ domain, including three in a seven-residue long N-terminal loop that undergoes a conformational switch as it wraps around c-di-GMP. This switch brings the PilZ domain into close apposition with the N-terminal domain, forming a new allosteric interaction surface that spans these domains and the c-di-GMP at their interface. The very small size of the N-terminal conformational switch is likely to explain the facile evolutionary diversification of the PilZ domain.},

abstract = {Translation of protein from mRNA is a complex multi-step process that occurs at a non-uniform rate. Variability in ribosome speed along an mRNA enables refinement of the proteome and plays a critical role in protein biogenesis. Detailed single protein studies have found both tRNA abundance and mRNA secondary structure as key modulators of translation elongation rate, but recent genome-wide ribosome profiling experiments have not observed significant influence of either on translation efficiency. Here we provide evidence that this results from an inherent trade-off between these factors. We find codons pairing to high-abundance tRNAs are preferentially used in regions of high secondary structure content, while codons read by significantly less abundant tRNAs are located in lowly structured regions. By considering long stretches of high and low mRNA secondary structure in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli and comparing them to randomized-gene models and experimental expression data, we were able to distinguish clear selective pressures and increased protein expression for specific codon choices. The trade-off between secondary structure and tRNA-concentration based codon choice allows for compensation of their independent effects on translation, helping to smooth overall translational speed and reducing the chance of potentially detrimental points of excessively slow or fast ribosome movement.},

Applying this to five TFs and a histone modification, we mapped thousands of cis-acting QTLs, with over 25-fold lower cost compared to standard QTL mapping. We found that single genetic variants frequently affect binding of multiple TFs, and CTCF can recruit all five TFs to its binding sites. These QTLs often affect local chromatin and transcription but can also influence long-range chromosomal contacts, demonstrating a role for natural genetic variation in chromosomal architecture. Thousands of these QTLs have been implicated in genome-wide association studies, providing candidate molecular mechanisms for many disease risk loci and suggesting that TF binding variation may underlie a large fraction of human phenotypic variation.},

abstract = {Attachment of ubiquitin to proteins is a crucial step in many cellular regulatory mechanisms and contributes to numerous biological processes, including embryonic development, the cell cycle, growth control, and prevention of neurodegeneration. In these diverse regulatory settings, the most widespread mechanism of ubiquitin action is probably in the context of protein degradation. Polyubiquitin attachment targets many intracellular proteins for degradation by the proteasome, and (mono)ubiquitination is often required for down-regulating plasma membrane proteins by targeting them to the vacuole (lysosome). Ubiquitin-protein conjugates are highly dynamic structures. While an array of enzymes directs the conjugation of ubiquitin to substrates, there are also dozens of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) that can reverse the process. Several lines of evidence indicate that DUBs are important regulators of the ubiquitin system. These enzymes are responsible for processing inactive ubiquitin precursors, proofreading ubiquitin-protein conjugates, removing ubiquitin from cellular adducts, and keeping the 26S proteasome free of inhibitory ubiquitin chains. The present review focuses on recent discoveries that have led to a better understanding the mechanisms and physiological roles of this diverse and still poorly understood group of enzymes. We also discuss briefly some of the proteases that act on ubiquitin-like protein (UBL) conjugates and compare them to DUBs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND A healthy immune system requires immune cells that adapt rapidly to environmental challenges. This phenotypic plasticity can be mediated by transcriptional and epigenetic variability. RESULTS We apply a novel analytical approach to measure and compare transcriptional and epigenetic variability genome-wide across CD14+CD16- monocytes, CD66b+CD16+ neutrophils, and CD4+CD45RA+ na{\"{i}}ve T cells from the same 125 healthy individuals. We discover substantially increased variability in neutrophils compared to monocytes and T cells. In neutrophils, genes with hypervariable expression are found to be implicated in key immune pathways and are associated with cellular properties and environmental exposure. We also observe increased sex-specific gene expression differences in neutrophils. Neutrophil-specific DNA methylation hypervariable sites are enriched at dynamic chromatin regions and active enhancers. CONCLUSIONS Our data highlight the importance of transcriptional and epigenetic variability for the key role of neutrophils as the first responders to inflammatory stimuli. We provide a resource to enable further functional studies into the plasticity of immune cells, which can be accessed from: http://blueprint-dev.bioinfo.cnio.es/WP10/hypervariability .},

abstract = {Differential DNA methylation is important for the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Allele-specific methylation of the inactive X chromosome has been demonstrated at promoter CpG islands, but the overall pattern of methylation on the active X (Xa) and inactive X (Xi) chromosomes is unknown. We performed allele-specific analysis of more than 1000 informative loci along the human X chromosome. The Xa displays more than two times as much allele-specific methylation as Xi. This methylation is concentrated at gene bodies, affecting multiple neighboring CpGs. Before X inactivation, all of these Xa gene body-methylated sites are biallelically methylated. Thus, a bipartite methylation-demethylation program results in Xa-specific hypomethylation at gene promoters and hypermethylation at gene bodies. These results suggest a relationship between global methylation and expression potentiality.},

In order to facilitate studies on predation by this organism, we have developed a method that assays killing of luminescent Escherichia coli by B. bacteriovorus. Moreover, we have used this assay to compare predation of cells by derivatives of B. bacteriovorus containing targeted mutations in genes we have identified. Two genes are described; one, mcp2, encoding a methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein (MCP) and the other, an mviN homologue. Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus mcp2::aphII were less efficient predators on luminescent E. coli than B. bacteriovorus containing a randomly inserted aphII gene via TnphoA transposition. These and other chemotaxis experiments implicated at least a minor role for chemotaxis in predation by B. bacteriovorus. They also open the way for further studies on Bdellovibrio ecology, genomics and predator–prey interactions. The results further confirm that Bdellovibrio uses a chemotaxis system in order to sense, and respond to, changes in its environment, including prey.},

abstract = {Coats plus (CP) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in CTC1, a component of the CST (CTC1, STN1, and TEN1) complex important for telomere length maintenance. The molecular basis of how CP mutations impact upon telomere length remains unclear. The CP CTC1L1142H mutation has been previously shown to disrupt telomere maintenance. In this study, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to engineer this mutation into both alleles of HCT116 and RPE cells to demonstrate that CTC1:STN1 interaction is required to repress telomerase activity. CTC1L1142H interacts poorly with STN1, leading to telomerase-mediated telomere elongation. Impaired interaction between CTC1L1142H:STN1 and DNA Pol-$\alpha$ results in increased telomerase recruitment to telomeres and further telomere elongation, revealing that C:S binding to DNA Pol-$\alpha$ is required to fully repress telomerase activity. CP CTC1 mutants that fail to interact with DNA Pol-$\alpha$ resulted in loss of C-strand maintenance and catastrophic telomere shortening. Our findings place the CST complex as an important regulator of both G-strand extensions by telomerase and C-strand synthesis by DNA Pol-$\alpha$.},

abstract = {Background: Aging is accompanied with loss of tissue homeostasis and accumulation of cellular damages. As one of the important metabolic centers, liver shows age-related dysregulation of lipid metabolism, impaired detoxification pathway, increased inflammation and oxidative stress response. However, the mechanisms for these age-related changes still remain unclear. In the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, liver-like functions are controlled by two distinct tissues, fat body and oenocytes. Compared to fat body, little is known about how oenocytes age and what are their roles in aging regulation. To characterize age- and stress-regulated gene expression in oenocytes, we performed cell-type-specific ribosome profiling (RiboTag) to examine the impacts of aging and oxidative stress on oenocyte translatome in Drosophila. Results: We show that aging and oxidant paraquat significantly increased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in adult oenocytes of Drosophila, and aged oenocytes exhibited reduced sensitivity to paraquat treatment. Through RiboTag sequencing, we identified 3324 and 949 differentially expressed genes in oenocytes under aging and paraquat treatment, respectively. Aging and paraquat exhibit both shared and distinct regulations on oenocyte translatome. Among all age-regulated genes, oxidative phosphorylation, ribosome, proteasome, fatty acid metabolism, and cytochrome P450 pathways were down-regulated, whereas DNA replication and immune response pathways were up-regulated. In addition, most of the peroxisomal genes were down-regulated in aged oenocytes, including genes involved in peroxisomal biogenesis factors and fatty acid beta-oxidation. Many age-related mRNA translational changes in oenocytes are similar to aged mammalian liver, such as up-regulation of innate immune response and Ras/MAPK signaling pathway and down-regulation of peroxisome and fatty acid metabolism. Furthermore, oenocytes highly expressed genes involving in liver-like processes (e.g., ketogenesis). Conclusions: Our oenocyte-specific translatome analysis identified many genes and pathways that are shared between Drosophila oenocytes and mammalian liver, highlighting the molecular and functional similarities between the two tissues. Many of these genes were altered in both oenocytes and liver during aging. Thus, our translatome analysis provide important genomic resource for future dissection of oenocyte function and its role in lipid metabolism, stress response and aging regulation.},

Here, we characterized the expression of mRNA and tRNA genes quantitatively at multiple time points in two developing mouse tissues. We discovered that mRNA codon pools are highly stable over development and simply reflect the genomic background; in contrast, precise regulation of tRNA gene families is required to create the corresponding tRNA transcriptomes. The dynamic regulation of tRNA genes during development is controlled in order to generate an anticodon pool that closely corresponds to messenger RNAs. Thus, across development, the pools of mRNA codons and tRNA anticodons are invariant and highly correlated, revealing a stable molecular interaction interlocking transcription and translation.},

We assess, quantitatively, the relative contribution of cis-genetic and epigenetic factors to transcription and evaluate their impact as potential sources of confounding in epigenome-wide association studies. Further, we characterize highly coordinated genetic effects on gene expression, methylation, and histone variation through quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and allele-specific (AS) analyses. Finally, we demonstrate colocalization of molecular trait QTLs at 345 unique immune disease loci.

abstract = {N6-methyl-adenosine (m6A) is one of the most common and abundant modifications on RNA molecules present in eukaryotes. However, the biological significance of m6A methylation remains largely unknown. Several independent lines of evidence suggest that the dynamic regulation of m6A may have a profound impact on gene expression regulation. The m6A modification is catalyzed by an unidentified methyltransferase complex containing at least one subunit methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3). m6A modification on messenger RNAs (mRNAs) mainly occurs in the exonic regions and 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) as revealed by high-throughput m6A-seq. One significant advance in m6A research is the recent discovery of the first two m6A RNA demethylases fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene and ALKBH5, which catalyze m6A demethylation in an ??-ketoglutarate (??-KG)- and Fe2+-dependent manner. Recent studies in model organisms demonstrate that METTL3, FTO and ALKBH5 play important roles in many biological processes, ranging from development and metabolism to fertility. Moreover, perturbation of activities of these enzymes leads to the disturbed expression of thousands of genes at the cellular level, implicating a regulatory role of m6A in RNA metabolism. Given the vital roles of DNA and histone methylations in epigenetic regulation of basic life processes in mammals, the dynamic and reversible chemical m6A modification on RNA may also serve as a novel epigenetic marker of profound biological significances. ?? 2013.},

abstract = {Chromatin methylation is necessary for stable repression of gene expression during mammalian development. During cell division, DNMT1 maintains the DNA methylation pattern of the newly synthesized daughter strand, while G9a methylates H3K9. Here, DNMT1 is shown to directly bind G9a both in vivo and in vitro and to colocalize in the nucleus during DNA replication. The complex of DNMT1 and G9a colocalizes with dimethylated H3K9 (H3K9me2) at replication foci. Similarly, another H3K9 histone methyltransferase, SUV39H1, colocalizes with DNMT1 on heterochromatic regions of the nucleoli exclusively before cell division. Both DNMT1 and G9a are loaded onto the chromatin simultaneously in a ternary complex with loading factor PCNA during chromatin replication. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of DNMT1 impairs DNA methylation, G9a loading, and H3K9 methylation on chromatin and rDNA repeats, confirming DNMT1 as the primary loading factor.

abstract = {DNA methylation (DNAm) is an important epigenetic process involved in the regulation of gene expression. While many studies have identified thousands of loci associated with age, few have differentiated between linear and non-linear DNAm trends with age. Non-linear trends could indicate early- or late-life gene regulatory processes. Using data from the Illumina 450K array on 336 human peripheral blood samples, we identified 21 CpG sites that associated with age (P{\textless}1.03E-7) and exhibited changing rates of DNAm change with age (P{\textless}1.94E-6). For two of these CpG sites (cg07955995 and cg22285878), DNAm increased with age at an increasing rate, indicating that differential DNAm was greatest among elderly individuals. We observed significant replication for both CpG sites (P{\textless}5.0E-8) in a second set of peripheral blood samples. In 8 of 9 additional datasets comprising samples of monocytes, T cell subtypes, and brain tissue, we observed a pattern directionally consistent with DNAm increasing with age at an increasing rate, which was nominally significant in the three largest datasets (4.3E-15{\textless}P{\textless}0.039). cg07955995 and cg22285878 reside in the promoter region of KLF14, which encodes a protein involved in immune cell differentiation via the repression of FOXP3. These findings may suggest a possible role for cg07955995 and cg22285878 in immunosenescence.},

To understand the biological significance of this epigenetic mark it is essential to know where in the genome it is located. New techniques are making it easier to map DNA methylation patterns on a large scale and the results have already provided surprises. In particular, the conventional view that DNA methylation functions predominantly to irreversibly silence transcription is being challenged. Not only is promoter methylation often highly dynamic during development, but many organisms also seem to target DNA methylation specifically to the bodies of active genes.},

abstract = {N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most prevalent internal (non-cap) modification present in the messenger RNA of all higher eukaryotes. Although essential to cell viability and development, the exact role of m(6)A modification remains to be determined. The recent discovery of two m(6)A demethylases in mammalian cells highlighted the importance of m(6)A in basic biological functions and disease. Here we show that m(6)A is selectively recognized by the human YTH domain family 2 (YTHDF2) 'reader' protein to regulate mRNA degradation. We identified over 3,000 cellular RNA targets of YTHDF2, most of which are mRNAs, but which also include non-coding RNAs, with a conserved core motif of G(m(6)A)C. We further establish the role of YTHDF2 in RNA metabolism, showing that binding of YTHDF2 results in the localization of bound mRNA from the translatable pool to mRNA decay sites, such as processing bodies. The carboxy-terminal domain of YTHDF2 selectively binds to m(6)A-containing mRNA, whereas the amino-terminal domain is responsible for the localization of the YTHDF2-mRNA complex to cellular RNA decay sites. Our results indicate that the dynamic m(6)A modification is recognized by selectively binding proteins to affect the translation status and lifetime of mRNA.},

abstract = {The potential impact of structural variants includes not only the duplication or deletion of coding sequences, but also the perturbation of non-coding DNA regulatory elements and structural chromatin features, including topological domains (TADs). Structural variants disrupting TAD boundaries have been implicated both in cancer and developmental disease; this likely occurs via ″enhancer hijacking″, whereby removal of the TAD boundary exposes enhancers to new target transcription start sites (TSSs). With this functional role, we hypothesized that boundaries would display evidence for negative selection. Here we demonstrate that the chromatin landscape constrains structural variation both within healthy humans and across primate evolution. In contrast, in patients with developmental delay, variants occur remarkably uniformly across genomic features, suggesting a potentially broad role for enhancer hijacking in human disease.},

abstract = {DNA methylation and nucleosome positioning work together to generate chromatin structures that regulate gene expression. Nucleosomes are typically mapped using nuclease digestion requiring significant amounts of material and varying enzyme concentrations. We have developed a method (NOMe-seq) that uses a GpC methyltransferase (M.CviPI) and next generation sequencing to generate a high resolution footprint of nucleosome positioning genome-wide using less than 1 million cells while retaining endogenous DNA methylation information from the same DNA strand. Using a novel bioinformatics pipeline, we show a striking anti-correlation between nucleosome occupancy and DNA methylation at CTCF regions that is not present at promoters. We further show that the extent of nucleosome depletion at promoters is directly correlated to expression level and can accommodate multiple nucleosomes and provide genome-wide evidence that expressed non-CpG island promoters are nucleosome-depleted. Importantly, NOMe-seq obtains DNA methylation and nucleosome positioning information from the same DNA molecule, giving the first genome-wide DNA methylation and nucleosome positioning correlation at the single molecule, and thus, single cell level, that can be used to monitor disease progression and response to therapy.},

abstract = {Mutations in the cytosine-5 RNA methyltransferase NSun2 cause microcephaly and other neurological abnormalities in mice and human. How post-transcriptional methylation contributes to the human disease is currently unknown. By comparing gene expression data with global cytosine-5 RNA methylomes in patient fibroblasts and NSun2-deficient mice, we find that loss of cytosine-5 RNA methylation increases the angiogenin-mediated endonucleolytic cleavage of transfer RNAs (tRNA) leading to an accumulation of 5' tRNA-derived small RNA fragments. Accumulation of 5' tRNA fragments in the absence of NSun2 reduces protein translation rates and activates stress pathways leading to reduced cell size and increased apoptosis of cortical, hippocampal and striatal neurons. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that angiogenin binds with higher affinity to tRNAs lacking site-specific NSun2-mediated methylation and that the presence of 5' tRNA fragments is sufficient and required to trigger cellular stress responses. Furthermore, the enhanced sensitivity of NSun2-deficient brains to oxidative stress can be rescued through inhibition of angiogenin during embryogenesis. In conclusion, failure in NSun2-mediated tRNA methylation contributes to human diseases via stress-induced RNA cleavage.},

The oscillations are extremely robust and persist well above room temperature in magnetic fields of only a few T. We attribute this phenomenon to repetitive changes in the electronic structure of superlattices such that charge carriers experience effectively no magnetic field at simple fractions of the flux quantum per superlattice unit cell.

abstract = {Autophagy is the bulk degradation of proteins and organelles, a process essential for cellular maintenance, cell viability, differentiation and development in mammals. Autophagy has significant associations with neurodegenerative diseases, cardiomyopathies, cancer, programmed cell death, and bacterial and viral infections. During autophagy, a cup-shaped structure, the preautophagosome, engulfs cytosolic components, including organelles, and closes, forming an autophagosome, which subsequently fuses with a lysosome, leading to the proteolytic degradation of internal components of the autophagosome by lysosomal lytic enzymes. During the formation of mammalian autophagosomes, two ubiquitylation-like modifications are required, Atg12-conjugation and LC3-modification. LC3 is an autophagosomal ortholog of yeast Atg8. A lipidated form of LC3, LC3-II, has been shown to be an autophagosomal marker in mammals, and has been used to study autophagy in neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases, tumorigenesis, and bacterial and viral infections. The other Atg8 homologues, GABARAP and GATE-16, are also modified by the same mechanism. In non-starved rats, the tissue distribution of LC3-II differs from those of the lipidated forms of GABARAP and GATE-16, GABARAP-II and GATE-16-II, suggesting that there is a functional divergence among these three modified proteins. Delipidation of LC3-II and GABARAP-II is mediated by hAtg4B. We review the molecular mechanism of LC3-modification, the crosstalk between LC3-modification and mammalian Atg12-conjugation, and the cycle of LC3-lipidation and delipidation mediated by hAtg4B, as well as recent findings concerning the other two Atg8 homologues, GABARAP and GATE-16. We also highlight recent findings regarding the pathobiology of LC3-modification, including its role in microbial infection, cancer and neuromuscular diseases.},

Dehydration-responsive elements (DREs) function as coupling elements of ABRE in the expression of RD29A in response to ABA. Expression analysis using abi3 and abi5 mutants showed that ABI3 and ABI5 play important roles in the expression of RD29B in seeds. Base-substitution analysis showed that two ABREs function strongly and one ABRE coupled with DRE functions weakly in the expression of RD29A in embryos. In a transient transactivation experiment, ABI3, ABI5 and AREB1 activated transcription of a GUS reporter gene driven by the RD29B promoter strongly but these proteins activated the transcription driven by the RD29A promoter weakly. In 35S::ABI3 Arabidopsis plants, the expression of RD29B was up-regulated strongly, but that of RD29A was up-regulated weakly. These results indicate that the expression of RD29B having ABREs in the promoter is up-regulated strongly by ABI3, whereas that of RD29A having one ABRE coupled with DREs in the promoter is up-regulated weakly by ABI3.

abstract = {Background: DNA is subject to constant chemical modification and damage, which eventually results in variable mutation rates throughout the genome. Although detailed molecular mechanisms of DNA damage and repair are well understood, damage impact and execution of repair across a genome remain poorly defined. Results: To bridge the gap between our understanding of DNA repair and mutation distributions, we developed a novel method, AP-seq, capable of mapping apurinic sites and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine bases at approximately 250-bp resolution on a genome-wide scale. We directly demonstrate that the accumulation rate of apurinic sites varies widely across the genome, with hot spots acquiring many times more damage than cold spots. Unlike single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in cancers, damage burden correlates with marks for open chromatin notably H3K9ac and H3K4me2. Apurinic sites and oxidative damage are also highly enriched in transposable elements and other repetitive sequences. In contrast, we observe a reduction at chromatin loop anchors with increased damage load towards inactive compartments. Less damage is found at promoters, exons, and termination sites, but not introns, in a seemingly transcription-independent but GC content-dependent manner. Leveraging cancer genomic data, we also find locally reduced SNV rates in promoters, coding sequence, and other functional elements. Conclusions: Our study reveals that oxidative DNA damage accumulation and repair differ strongly across the genome, but culminate in a previously unappreciated mechanism that safeguards the regulatory and coding regions of genes from mutations.},

abstract = {This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the strength and magnitude of the association between birthweight and adult bone mass. Higher birthweight was associated with higher bone mineral content of the spine and hip in adult men and women at ages between 18 and 80 years across a range of settings. Introduction: The aim of this review was to assess the strength and magnitude of the association between early size and adult bone mass. Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that assessed the association between birthweight or weight at 1 year, and bone mineral content (BMC) or bone mineral density (BMD) in adulthood. Results: Fourteen studies met inclusion criteria. Nine assessed the relationship between birthweight and lumbar spine BMC, most showing that higher birthweight was associated with greater adult BMC. Meta-analysis demonstrated that a 1 kg increase in birthweight was associated with a 1.49 g increase in lumbar spine BMC (95{\%} CI 0.77-2.21). Birthweight was not associated with lumbar spine BMD in 11 studies. In six studies, considering the relationship between birthweight and hip BMC, most found that higher birthweight was associated with greater BMC. Meta-analysis demonstrated that a 1 kg increase in birthweight was associated with a 1.41 g increase in hip BMC (95{\%} CI 0.91-1.91). Seven studies considered the relationship between birthweight and hip BMD and, in most, birthweight was not a significant predictor of hip BMD. Three studies assessing the relationship between weight at 1 year and adult bone mass all reported that higher weight at one was associated with greater BMC of the lumbar spine and hip. Conclusions: Higher birthweight is associated with greater BMC of the lumbar spine and hip in adulthood. The consistency of these associations, across a range of settings, provides compelling evidence for the intrauterine programming of skeletal development and tracking of skeletal size from infancy to adulthood. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.},

Despite their fundamental biological importance, it has been difficult to elucidate their mode-of-action using standard bioinformatic, biochemical, or genetic approaches. In recent years, surrogate hosts including the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have become increasingly popular to aid the study of effectors. Expression of effectors in yeast can result in phenotypes that may be exploited to elucidate the processes they target, gain insight into their enzymatic function, and understand target-effector relationships. Moreover, chemical genomic approaches in yeast may be used to ascribe functions to these proteins as well as identify lead compounds that may be useful for antimicrobial therapies. The recent successes of the yeast system establish it as a standard tool for the study of bacterial effector proteins.},

abstract = {The human genome contains approximately one million Alu repetitive elements comprising 10{\%} of the genome, yet their functions are not well understood. Here, we show that Alu elements resemble enhancers. Alu elements are bound by two well-phased nucleosomes that contain histones bearing marks of active chromatin, and they show tissue-specific enrichment for the enhancer mark H3K4me1. A proportion of Alu elements were experimentally validated as bona fide active enhancers with an invitro reporter assay. In addition, Hi-C data indicate that Alus show long-range interactions with gene promoters. We also find that Alus are generally more conserved when located in the proximal upstream region of genes. Their similarity to enhancers becomes more prominent with their age in the human genome, following a clear evolutionary continuum reminiscent of the evolutionary pattern of proto-genes. Therefore, we conclude that some Alu elements can function as enhancers and propose that many more may be proto-enhancers that serve as a repertoire for the de novo birth of enhancers. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {DNA methylation is a major determinant of epigenetic inheritance and plays an important role in genome stability. The accurate propagation of DNA methylation patterns with cell division requires that methylation be closely coupled to DNA replication, however the precise molecular determinants of this interaction have not been defined. In the present study, we show that the predominant DNA methyltransferase species in somatic cells, DNMT1, is a component of a multiprotein DNA replication complex termed the DNA synthesome that fully supports semi-conservative DNA replication in a cell-free system. DNMT1 protein and activity were found to co-purify with the human DNA synthesome through a series of subcellular fractionation and chromatography steps, resulting in an enrichment of methyltransferase specific activity from two human cell lines. DNA methyltransferase activity co-eluted with in vitro replication activity and DNA polymerase alpha activity on sucrose density gradients suggesting that DNMT1 is a tightly bound, core component of the replication complex. The synthesome-associated pool of DNA methyltransferase exhibited both maintenance and de novo methyltransferase activity and the ratio of the two was similar to that observed in whole cell lysates and for recombinant DNMT1. These data indicate that interactions within the synthesome complex do not influence the intrinsic preference of DNMT1 for hemimethylated DNA, but suggest that newly replicated DNA may be subject to low level de novo methylation. The data indicate that DNA methylation is tightly coupled to replication through physical interaction of DNMT1 and core components of the replication machinery. The definition of the molecular interactions between DNMT1 and other proteins in the replication complex in normal and neoplastic cells will provide further insight into the regulation of DNA methylation and the mechanisms underlying the alteration of DNA methylation patterns during carcinogenesis.},

Departures of methylation-estimated age from actual age can be used to define epigenetic measures of child development or age acceleration (AA) in adults. Very little is known about genetic or environmental determinants of these epigenetic measures of aging. We obtained DNA methylation profiles using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips across five time-points in 1018 mother-child pairs from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Using the Horvath age estimation method, we calculated epigenetic age for these samples. AA was defined as the residuals from regressing epigenetic age on actual age. AA was tested for associations with cross-sectional clinical variables in children. We identified associations between AA and sex, birth weight, birth by caesarean section and several maternal characteristics in pregnancy, namely smoking, weight, BMI, selenium and cholesterol level. Offspring of non-drinkers had higher AA on average but this difference appeared to resolve during childhood. The associations between sex, birth weight and AA found in ARIES were replicated in an independent cohort (GOYA). In children, epigenetic AA measures are associated with several clinically relevant variables, and early life exposures appear to be associated with changes in AA during adolescence. Further research into epigenetic aging, including the use of causal inference methods, is required to better our understanding of aging.},

This recruitment is important for generating axial tension on the pericentromere and coordinating movement between pericentromeres from different chromosomes.

Our results explain the preferential susceptibility of certain CpG islands to aberrant methylation and point to transcriptional state and the associated chromatin landscape as the strongest predictors. Although DNA methylation and H3K27me3 are usually non-overlapping at CpG islands, H3K27me3 can transiently co-occur with DNMT3B-induced DNA methylation.

abstract = {Human ABCG2 belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family and plays an important role in various biological reactions, such as xenobiotic elimination and homeostasis of protoporphyrin. We previously reported that ABCG2 exists in the plasma membrane as a homodimer bound via a disulfide bond at Cys-603. In the present study, we examined the importance of an intramolecular disulfide bond for stability of the ABCG2 protein. Substitution of either Cys-592 or Cys-608 located in the extracellular loop to glycine resulted in a significant decrease in protein levels of ABCG2 when expressed in Flp-In-293 cells. Interestingly, the protein levels of those ABCG2 variants were remarkably enhanced by treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Concomitantly, increases in ubiquitinated forms of those variant proteins were detected by immunoprecipitation. In contrast, neither the protein level nor the ubiquitinated state of the ABCG2 wild-type (WT) was affected by MG132 treatment. Ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation is suggested to be involved in degradation of misfolded ABCG2 proteins lacking the intramolecular disulfide bond. On the other hand, the protein level of ABCG2 WT increased more than 4-fold when cells were treated with bafilomycin A(1), which inhibits lysosomal degradation, whereas the C592G or C608G variant was little affected by the same treatment. These results strongly suggest that two distinct pathways exist for protein degradation of ABCG2 WT and mutants lacking the intramolecular disulfide bond. Namely, the WT ABCG2 is degraded in lysosomes, and the misfolded ABCG2 lacking intramolecular disulfide bond undergoes ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation in proteasomes.},

To streamline the data processing of DNA methylation from multiple RRBS samples, we present a flexible pipeline named SMAP, whose features include: (i) handling of single—and/or paired-end diverse bisulfite sequencing data with reduced false-positive rates in differentially methylated regions; (ii) detection of allele-specific methylation events with improved algorithms; (iii) a built-in pipeline for detection of novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); (iv) support of multiple user-defined restriction enzymes; (v) conduction of all methylation analyses in a single-step operation when well configured. Simulation and experimental data validated the high accuracy of SMAP for SNP detection and methylation identification. Most analyses required in methylation studies (such as estimation of methylation levels, differentially methylated cytosine groups, and allele-specific methylation regions) can be executed readily with SMAP.

abstract = {In this contribution, we describe a multi-omics systems biology study of the metabolic changes that occur during aging in Caenorhabditis elegans. Sampling several time points from young adulthood until early old age, our study covers the full duration of aging and include transcriptomics, and targeted MS-based metabolomics. In order to focus on the metabolic changes due to age we used two strains that are metabolically close to wild-type, yet are conditionally non-reproductive. Using these data in combination with a whole-genome model of the metabolism of C. elegans and mathematical modeling, we predicted metabolic fluxes during early aging. We find that standard Flux Balance Analysis does not accurately predict in vivo measured fluxes nor age-related changes associated with the Citric Acid cycle. We present a novel Flux Balance Analysis method where we combined biomass production and targeted metabolomics information to generate an objective function that is more suitable for aging studies. We validated this approach with a detailed case study of the age-associated changes in the Citric Acid cycle. Our approach provides a comprehensive time-resolved multi-omics and modeling resource for studying the metabolic changes during normal aging in C. elegans},

abstract = {CpG islands (CGIs) are interspersed DNA sequences that have unusually high CpG ratios and GC contents. CGIs are typically located in the promoter of protein-coding genes. They normally lack DNA methylation but become hypermethylated and induce repression of associated genes in cancer. However, the biological functions of non-promoter CGIs (orphan CGIs) largely remain unclear. Here, we identify orphan CGIs that do not map to the promoter of any protein-coding or non-coding transcripts but possess chromatin and transcriptional marks that reflect enhancer activity (termed eCGIs). They exhibit three-dimensional chromatin looping toward multiple target genes with high affinity. Intriguingly, transcription regulators were frequently associated with such CGI-containing enhancers. Remarkably, our analyses in cell lines and clinical tissues showed that eCGIs have more dynamic DNA methylation changes in cancer relative to promoter CGIs. The observed eCGI hypermethylation was accompanied by a loss of enhancer marks and transcriptional inactivation of the target genes. Our results suggest that eCGIs may constitute a distinct class of enhancers and perform a more instrumental role in tumorigenesis than typical CGIs in gene promoters.},

@article{Skvortsova2017,
abstract = {BACKGROUND The discovery that 5-methylcytosine (5mC) can be oxidized to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) by the ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins has prompted wide interest in the potential role of 5hmC in reshaping the mammalian DNA methylation landscape. The gold-standard bisulphite conversion technologies to study DNA methylation do not distinguish between 5mC and 5hmC. However, new approaches to mapping 5hmC genome-wide have advanced rapidly, although it is unclear how the different methods compare in accurately calling 5hmC. In this study, we provide a comparative analysis on brain DNA using three 5hmC genome-wide approaches, namely whole-genome bisulphite/oxidative bisulphite sequencing (WG Bis/OxBis-seq), Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays coupled with oxidative bisulphite (HM450K Bis/OxBis) and antibody-based immunoprecipitation and sequencing of hydroxymethylated DNA (hMeDIP-seq). We also perform loci-specific TET-assisted bisulphite sequencing (TAB-seq) for validation of candidate regions. RESULTS We show that whole-genome single-base resolution approaches are advantaged in providing precise 5hmC values but require high sequencing depth to accurately measure 5hmC, as this modification is commonly in low abundance in mammalian cells. HM450K arrays coupled with oxidative bisulphite provide a cost-effective representation of 5hmC distribution, at CpG sites with 5hmC levels {\textgreater}{\~{}}10{\%}. However, 5hmC analysis is restricted to the genomic location of the probes, which is an important consideration as 5hmC modification is commonly enriched at enhancer elements. Finally, we show that the widely used hMeDIP-seq method provides an efficient genome-wide profile of 5hmC and shows high correlation with WG Bis/OxBis-seq 5hmC distribution in brain DNA. However, in cell line DNA with low levels of 5hmC, hMeDIP-seq-enriched regions are not detected by WG Bis/OxBis or HM450K, either suggesting misinterpretation of 5hmC calls by hMeDIP or lack of sensitivity of the latter methods. CONCLUSIONS We highlight both the advantages and caveats of three commonly used genome-wide 5hmC profiling technologies and show that interpretation of 5hmC data can be significantly influenced by the sensitivity of methods used, especially as the levels of 5hmC are low and vary in different cell types and different genomic locations.},

abstract = {Autophagy has been implicated in a number of physiological processes important for human heath and disease. Autophagy involves the formation of a double-membrane cytosolic vesicle, an autophagosome. Central to the formation of the autophagosome is the ubiquitin-like protein autophagy-related (Atg)8 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3/LC3 in mammalian cells). Following autophagy induction, Atg8 shows the greatest change in expression of any of the proteins required for autophagy. The magnitude of autophagy is, in part, controlled by the amount of Atg8; thus, controlling Atg8 protein levels is one potential mechanism for modulating autophagy activity. We have identified a negative regulator of ATG8 transcription, Ume6, which acts along with a histone deacetylase complex including Sin3 and Rpd3 to regulate Atg8 levels; deletion of any of these components leads to an increase in Atg8 and a concomitant increase in autophagic activity. A similar regulatory mechanism is present in mammalian cells, indicating that this process is highly conserved.},

However, predicted loss-of-function variants are enriched for annotation errors, and tend to be found at extremely low frequencies, so their analysis requires careful variant annotation and very large sample sizes1. Here we describe the aggregation of 125,748 exomes and 15,708 genomes from human sequencing studies into the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). We identify 443,769 high-confidence predicted loss-of-function variants in this cohort after filtering for artefacts caused by sequencing and annotation errors. Using an improved model of human mutation rates, we classify human protein-coding genes along a spectrum that represents tolerance to inactivation, validate this classification using data from model organisms and engineered human cells, and show that it can be used to improve the power of gene discovery for both common and rare diseases.},

Monomeric beta-arrs are believed to interact with receptors after agonist activation, and therefore, beta-arr oligomers have been proposed to represent a resting biologically inactive state. In contrast to this, we report here that the interaction with and subsequent titration out of the nucleus of the protooncogene Mdm2 specifically require beta-arr2 oligomers together with the previously characterized nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of beta-arr2. Mutation of the IP6-binding sites impair oligomerization, reduce interaction with Mdm2, and inhibit p53-dependent antiproliferative effects of beta-arr2, whereas the competence for receptor regulation and signaling is maintained. These observations suggest that the intracellular concentration of beta-arr2 oligomers might control cell survival and proliferation.},

abstract = {Within Myxococcus xanthus biofilms, cells actively move and exchange their outer membrane (OM) lipoproteins and lipids. Between genetically distinct strains, OM exchange can regulate recipient cell behaviors, including gliding motility and development. Although many different proteins are thought to be exchanged, to date, only two endogenous OM lipoproteins, CglB and Tgl, are known to be transferred. Protein exchange requires the TraAB proteins in recipient and donor cells, where they are hypothesized to facilitate OM fusion for transfer. To better understand the types of proteins exchanged, we identified the genes for the remaining set of cgl gliding motility mutants. These mutants are unique because their motility defect can be transiently restored by physical contact with donor cells that encode the corresponding wild-type protein, a process called stimulation. Similar to CglB and Tgl, the cglC and cglD genes encode type II signal sequences, suggesting that they are also lipoproteins. Surprisingly, the cglE and cglF genes instead encode type I signal sequences, suggesting that nonlipoproteins are also exchanged. Consistent with this idea, the addition of exogenous synthetic CglF protein (71 amino acids) to a cglF mutant rescued its motility defect. In contrast to a live donor cell, stimulation with purified CglF protein occurred independently of TraA. These results also indicate that CglF may localize to the cell surface. The implications of our findings on OM exchange are discussed.},

abstract = {CheY-like phosphoacceptor (or receiver [REC]) domain is a common module in a variety of response regulators of the bacterial signal transduction systems. In this work, 4,610 response regulators, encoded in complete genomes of 200 bacterial and archaeal species, were identified and classified by their domain architectures. Previously uncharacterized output domains were analyzed and, in some cases, assigned to known domain families. Transcriptional regulators of the OmpR, NarL, and NtrC families were found to comprise almost 60{\%} of all response regulators; transcriptional regulators with other DNA-binding domains (LytTR, AraC, Spo0A, Fis, YcbB, RpoE, and MerR) account for an additional 6{\%}. The remaining one-third is represented by the stand-alone REC domain (approximately 14{\%}) and its combinations with a variety of enzymatic (GGDEF, EAL, HD-GYP, CheB, CheC, PP2C, and HisK), RNA-binding (ANTAR and CsrA), protein- or ligand-binding (PAS, GAF, TPR, CAP{\_}ED, and HPt) domains, or newly described domains of unknown function. The diversity of domain architectures and the abundance of alternative domain combinations suggest that fusions between the REC domain and various output domains is a widespread evolutionary mechanism that allows bacterial cells to regulate transcription, enzyme activity, and/or protein-protein interactions in response to environmental challenges. The complete list of response regulators encoded in each of the 200 analyzed genomes is available online at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Complete{\_}Genomes/RRcensus.html.},

Before tomograms can be interpreted reliably, for example, by 3D segmentation, it is essential that the data be suitably denoised using procedures that can be individually optimized for specific data sets. Here, we implement a systematic procedure to compare various nonlinear denoising techniques on tomograms recorded at room temperature and at cryogenic temperatures, and establish quantitative criteria to select a denoising approach that is most relevant for a given tomogram. We demonstrate that using an appropriate denoising algorithm facilitates robust segmentation of tomograms of HIV-infected macrophages and Bdellovibrio bacteria obtained from specimens at room and cryogenic temperatures, respectively. We validate this strategy of automated segmentation of optimally denoised tomograms by comparing its performance with manual extraction of key features from the same tomograms.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A major disadvantage of second trimester amniocentesis is that the result is usually available only after 18 weeks' gestation. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and early amniocentesis can be done between 9 and 14 weeks and offer an earlier alternative. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to assess comparative safety and accuracy of second trimester amniocentesis, early amniocentesis, transcervical and transabdominal CVS. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (March 2003) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2002). SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised trials comparing amniocentesis and CVS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers assessed eligibility and trial quality and performed data extraction. We analysed the data using RevMan software. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 14 randomised studies have been included. In a low risk population with a background pregnancy loss of around 2{\%}, a second trimester amniocentesis will increase this risk by another 1{\%}. This difference did not reach statistical significance, but the increase in spontaneous miscarriages following second trimester amniocentesis compared with controls (no amniocentesis) did (2.1{\%} versus 1.3{\%}; relative risk (RR) 1.02 to 2.52). Early amniocentesis is not a safe early alternative to second trimester amniocentesis because of increased pregnancy loss (7.6{\%} versus 5.9{\%}; RR 1.29, 95{\%} CI 1.03 to 1.61) and higher incidence of talipes compared to CVS (1.8{\%} versus 0.2{\%}; RR 6.43, 95{\%} CI 1.68 to 24.64).Compared with second trimester amniocentesis, transcervical CVS carries a significantly higher risk of pregnancy loss (14.5{\%} versus 11{\%}; RR 1.40, 95{\%} CI 1.09 to 1.81) and spontaneous miscarriage (12.9{\%} versus 9.4{\%}; RR 1.50, 95{\%} CI 1.07 to 2.11). One study compared transabdominal CVS with second trimester amniocentesis and found no significant difference in the total pregnancy loss between the two procedures (6.3{\%} versus 7{\%}). Transcervical CVS is more technically demanding than transabdominal CVS with more failures to obtain sample and more multiple insertions. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Second trimester amniocentesis is safer than transcervical CVS and early amniocentesis. If earlier diagnosis is required, transabdominal CVS is preferable to early amniocentesis or transcervical CVS. In circumstances where transabdominal CVS may be technically difficult the preferred options are transcervical CVS in the first trimester or second trimester amniocentesis.},

abstract = {DNA methylation is the most studied epigenetic mark and CpG methylation is central to many biological processes and human diseases. Since cancer has highlighted the contribution to disease of aberrant DNA methylation patterns, such as the presence of promoter CpG island hypermethylation-associated silencing of tumor suppressor genes and global DNA hypomethylation defects, their importance will surely become apparent in other pathologies. However, advances in obtaining comprehensive DNA methylomes are hampered by the high cost and time-consuming aspects of the single nucleotide methods currently available for whole genome DNA methylation analyses. Following the success of the standard CpG methylation microarrays for 1,505 CpG sites and 27,000 CpG sites, we have validated in vivo the newly developed 450,000 (450K) cytosine microarray (Illumina). The 450K microarray includes CpG and CNG sites, CpG islands/shores/shelves/open sea, non-coding RNA (microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs) and sites surrounding the transcription start sites (-200 bp to -1,500 bp, 5'-UTRs and exons 1) for coding genes, but also for the corresponding gene bodies and 3'-UTRs, in addition to intergenic regions derived from GWAS studies. Herein, we demonstrate that the 450K DNA methylation array can consistently and significantly detect CpG methylation changes in the HCT-116 colorectal cancer cell line in comparison with normal colon mucosa or HCT-116 cells with defective DNA methyltransferases (DKO). The provided validation highlights the potential use of the 450K DNA methylation microarray as a useful tool for ongoing and newly designed epigenome projects.},

They include the budding and fission yeast, worm, fruit fly, fugu, chicken, dog, rat, mouse, chimp and human. The number of tRNA genes are between 170 and 570 and the number of tRNA isoacceptors range from 41 to 55. Unexpectedly, the number of tRNA genes having the same anticodon but different sequences elsewhere in the tRNA body (defined here as tRNA isodecoder genes) varies significantly (10-246). tRNA isodecoder genes allow up to 274 different tRNA species to be produced from 446 genes in humans, but only up to 51 from 275 genes in the budding yeast. The fraction of tRNA isodecoder genes among all tRNA genes increases across the phylogenetic spectrum. A large number of sequence differences in human tRNA isodecoder genes occurs in the internal promoter regions for RNA polymerase III. We also describe a systematic, ligation-based method to detect and quantify tRNA isodecoder molecules in human samples, and show differential expression of three tRNA isodecoders in six human tissues. The large number of tRNA isodecoder genes in eukaryotes suggests that tRNA function may be more diverse than previously appreciated.},

abstract = {Background: Cerebroretinal microangiopathy with calcifications and cysts (CRMCC) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by pathogenic variants of the conserved telomere maintenance component 1 (CTC1) gene. The CTC1 forms the telomeric capping complex, CST, which functions in telomere homeostasis and replication. Methods: A Brazilian pedigree and an Australian pedigree were referred to the International Registry of Werner Syndrome (Seattle, WA, USA), with clinical features of accelerated aging and recurrent bone fractures. Whole exome sequencing was performed to identify the genetic causes. Results: Whole exome sequencing of the Brazilian pedigree revealed compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in CTC1: a missense mutation (c.2959C{\textgreater}T, p.Arg987Trp) and a novel stop codon change (c.322C{\textgreater}T, p.Arg108*). The Australian patient carried two novel heterozygous CTC1 variants, c.2916G{\textgreater}T, p.Val972Gly and c.2926G{\textgreater}T, p.Val976Phe within the same allele. Both heterozygous variants were inherited from the unaffected father, excluding the diagnosis of CRMCC in this pedigree. Cell biological studies demonstrated accumulation of double strand break foci in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from the patients. Increased DSB foci were extended to non-telomeric regions of the genome, in agreement with previous biochemical studies showing a preferential binding of CTC1 protein to GC-rich sequences. Conclusion: CTC1 pathogenic variants can present with unusual manifestations of progeria accompanied with recurrent bone fractures. Further studies are needed to elucidate the disease mechanism leading to the clinical presentation with intra-familial variations of CRMCC.},

They are 300-bp non-coding sequences transcribed by RNA polymerase III (Pol III) and are expected to retrotranspose with the aid of reverse transcriptases of cellular origin. We previously showed that human LINEs can generate cDNA copies of any mRNA transcript by means of a retroposition process involving reverse transcription and integration by the LINE-encoded endonuclease and reverse transcriptase. Here we show mobility of marked Alu sequences in human HeLa cells with the canonical features of a retrotransposition process, including splicing out of an autocatalytic intron introduced into the marked sequence, target site duplications of varying lengths and integrations into consensus A-rich sequences. We further show that the poly-A stretch at the Alu 3′ end is essential for mobility, that LINEs are required for transposition and that the rate of retroposition is 100-1,000 times higher for Alu transcripts than for control mRNAs, thus accounting for the high mutational activity of these elements observed in humans.},

We analysed {\textgreater}480 000 CpG sites using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina) in whole blood DNA of 965 participants of a population-based cohort study aged between 50 and 75 years. In an exploratory analysis in 400 individuals, 200 CpG sites with the highest Spearman correlation coefficients for the association between methylation and age were identified. Of these 200 CpGs, 162 were significantly associated with age, which was verified in an independent cohort of 498 individuals using mixed linear regression models adjusted for gender, smoking behaviour, age-related diseases and random batch effect and corrected for multiple testing by Bonferroni. In another independent cohort of 67 individuals without history of major age-related diseases and with a follow-up of 8 years, we observed a gain in methylation at 96{\%} (52{\%}, significant) of the positively age-associated CpGs and a loss at all (89{\%}, significant) of the negatively age-associated CpGs in each individual while getting 8 years older. A regression model for age prediction based on 17 CpGs as predicting variables explained 71{\%} of the variance in age with an average accuracy of 2.6 years. In comparison with cord blood samples obtained from the Ulm Birth Cohort Study, we observed a more than 2-fold change in mean methylation levels from birth to older age at 86 CpGs. We were able to identify 65 novel CpG sites with significant association of methylation with age.},

Using methylation-sensitive SNP analysis (MSNP), we surveyed the human genome at 50K and 250K resolution, identifying ASM as recurrent genotype call conversions from heterozygosity to homozygosity when genomic DNAs were predigested with the methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme HpaII. Using independent assays, we confirmed ASM at 16 SNP-tagged loci distributed across various chromosomes. At 12 of these loci (75{\%}), the ASM tracked strongly with the sequence of adjacent SNPs. Further analysis showed allele-specific mRNA expression at two loci from this methylation-based screen--the vanin and CYP2A6-CYP2A7 gene clusters--both implicated in traits of medical importance. This recurrent phenomenon of sequence-dependent ASM has practical implications for mapping and interpreting associations of noncoding SNPs and haplotypes with human phenotypes.},

abstract = {Two-component signal transduction systems are the predominant means by which bacteria sense and respond to environmental stimuli. Bacteria often employ tens or hundreds of these paralogous signaling systems, comprised of histidine kinases (HKs) and their cognate response regulators (RRs). Faithful transmission of information through these signaling pathways and avoidance of detrimental crosstalk demand exquisite specificity of HK-RR interactions. To identify the determinants of two-component signaling specificity, we examined patterns of amino acid coevolution in large, multiple sequence alignments of cognate kinase-regulator pairs. Guided by these results, we demonstrate that a subset of the coevolving residues is sufficient, when mutated, to completely switch the substrate specificity of the kinase EnvZ. Our results shed light on the basis of molecular discrimination in two-component signaling pathways, provide a general approach for the rational rewiring of these pathways, and suggest that analyses of coevolution may facilitate the reprogramming of other signaling systems and protein-protein interactions.},

However, the mechanisms underlying age-related DNA methylation changes remain mostly undiscovered.Here we discuss the current knowledge of the dynamic nature of DNA epigenome landscape in mammals, and propose putative molecular mechanisms for aging-associated DNA epigenetic changes. Specifically, we describe age-related variations of methylcytosine and its oxidative derivatives in relation to the dynamics of chromatin structure, histone post-translational modifications and their modulators.Finally, we are proposing a conceptual framework that could explain the complex nature of the effects of age on DNA methylation patterns. This combines the accumulation of DNA methylation noise and also all of the predictable, site-specific DNA methylation changes.Gathering information in this area would pave the way for future investigation aimed at establishing a possible causative role of epigenetic mechanisms in aging.},

abstract = {Experimental and computational approaches to estimate solubility and permeability in discovery and development settings are described. In the discovery setting 'the rule of 5' predicts that poor absorption or permeation is more likely when there are more than 5 H-bond donors, 10 H-bond acceptors, the molecular weight (MWT) is greater than 500 and the calculated Log P (CLogP) is greater than 5 (or MlogP {\textgreater} 4.15). Computational methodology for the rule-based Moriguchi Log P (MLogP) calculation is described. Turbidimetric solubility measurement is described and applied to known drugs. High throughput screening (HTS) leads tend to have higher MWT and Log P and lower turbidimetric solubility than leads in the pre-HTS era. In the development setting, solubility calculations focus on exact value prediction and are difficult because of polymorphism. Recent work on linear free energy relationships and Log P approaches are critically reviewed. Useful predictions are possible in closely related analog series when coupled with experimental thermodynamic solubility measurements.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Inherited mutations in the BRCA1 gene may be responsible for almost half of inherited breast carcinomas. However, somatic (acquired) mutations in BRCA1 have not been reported, despite frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH or loss of one copy of the gene) at the BRCA1 locus and loss of BRCA1 protein in tumors. To address whether BRCA1 may be inactivated by pathways other than mutations in sporadic tumors, we analyzed the role of hypermethylation of the gene's promoter region. METHODS Methylation patterns in the BRCA1 promoter were assessed in breast cancer cell lines, xenografts, and 215 primary breast and ovarian carcinomas by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). BRCA1 RNA expression was determined in cell lines and seven xenografts by reverse transcription-PCR. P values are two-sided. RESULTS The BRCA1 promoter was found to be unmethylated in all normal tissues and cancer cell lines tested. However, BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation was present in two breast cancer xenografts, both of which had loss of the BRCA1 transcript. BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation was present in 11 (13{\%}) of 84 unselected primary breast carcinomas. BRCA1 methylation was strikingly associated with the medullary (67{\%} methylated; P =.0002 versus ductal) and mucinous (55{\%} methylated; P =.0033 versus ductal) subtypes, which are overrepresented in BRCA1 families. In a second series of 66 ductal breast tumors informative for LOH, nine (20{\%}) of 45 tumors with LOH had BRCA1 hypermethylation, while one (5{\%}) of 21 without LOH was methylated (P =.15). In ovarian neoplasms, BRCA1 methylation was found only in tumors with LOH, four (31{\%}) of 13 versus none of 18 without LOH (P =.02). The BRCA1 promoter was unmethylated in other tumor types. CONCLUSION Silencing of the BRCA1 gene by promoter hypermethylation occurs in primary breast and ovarian carcinomas, especially in the presence of LOH and in specific histopathologic subgroups. These findings support a role for this tumor suppressor gene in sporadic breast and ovarian tumorigenesis.},

Pol III localization in other transformed and primary cell lines reveals previously uncharacterized and cell type-specific Pol III loci as well as one microRNA. Notably, only a fraction of the in silico-predicted Pol III loci are occupied. Many occupied Pol III genes reside within an annotated Pol II promoter. Outside of Pol II promoters, occupied Pol III genes overlap with enhancer-like chromatin and enhancer-binding proteins such as ETS1 and STAT1. Moreover, Pol III occupancy scales with the levels of nearby Pol II, active chromatin and CpG content. These results suggest that active chromatin gates Pol III accessibility to the genome.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND DNA methylation is an important type of epigenetic modification involved in gene regulation. Although strong DNA methylation at promoters is widely recognized to be associated with transcriptional repression, many aspects of DNA methylation remain not fully understood, including the quantitative relationships between DNA methylation and expression levels, and the individual roles of promoter and gene body methylation. RESULTS Here we present an integrated analysis of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and RNA sequencing data from human samples and cell lines. We find that while promoter methylation inversely correlates with gene expression as generally observed, the repressive effect is clear only on genes with a very high DNA methylation level. By means of statistical modeling, we find that DNA methylation is indicative of the expression class of a gene in general, but gene body methylation is a better indicator than promoter methylation. These findings are general in that a model constructed from a sample or cell line could accurately fit the unseen data from another. We further find that promoter and gene body methylation have minimal redundancy, and either one is sufficient to signify low expression. Finally, we obtain increased modeling power by integrating histone modification data with the DNA methylation data, showing that neither type of information fully subsumes the other. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that DNA methylation outside promoters also plays critical roles in gene regulation. Future studies on gene regulatory mechanisms and disease-associated differential methylation should pay more attention to DNA methylation at gene bodies and other non-promoter regions.},

Although assays utilizing PCR amplification of bisulfite-converted DNA are widely employed to analyze these DNA methylation alterations, they are generally limited in throughput capacity, detection sensitivity, and or resolution. Digital PCR, in which a DNA sample is analyzed in distributive fashion over multiple reaction chambers, allows for enumeration of discrete template DNA molecules, as well as sequestration of non-specific primer annealing templates into negative chambers, thereby increasing the signal-to-noise ratio in positive chambers. Here, we have applied digital PCR technology to bisulfite-converted DNA for single-molecule high-resolution DNA methylation analysis and for increased sensitivity DNA methylation detection. We developed digital bisulfite genomic DNA sequencing to efficiently determine single-basepair DNA methylation patterns on single-molecule DNA templates without an interim cloning step. We also developed digital MethyLight, which surpasses traditional MethyLight in detection sensitivity and quantitative accuracy for low quantities of DNA. Using digital MethyLight, we identified single-molecule, cancer-specific DNA hypermethylation events in the CpG islands of RUNX3, CLDN5 and FOXE1 present in plasma samples from breast cancer patients.},

abstract = {DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification that has essential roles in cellular processes including gene regulation, development and disease and is widely dysregulated in most types of cancer. Recent advances in sequencing technology have enabled the measurement of DNA methylation at single nucleotide resolution through methods such as whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. In DNA methylation studies, a key task is to identify differences under distinct biological contexts, for example, between tumor and normal tissue. A challenge in sequencing studies is that the number of biological replicates is often limited by the costs of sequencing. The small number of replicates leads to unstable variance estimation, which can reduce accuracy to detect differentially methylated loci (DML). Here we propose a novel statistical method to detect DML when comparing two treatment groups. The sequencing counts are described by a lognormal-beta-binomial hierarchical model, which provides a basis for information sharing across different CpG sites. A Wald test is developed for hypothesis testing at each CpG site. Simulation results show that the proposed method yields improved DML detection compared to existing methods, particularly when the number of replicates is low. The proposed method is implemented in the Bioconductor package DSS.},

abstract = {In multiple studies DNA methylation has proven to be an accurate biomarker of age. To develop these biomarkers, the methylation of multiple CpG sites is typically linearly combined to predict chronological age. By contrast, in this study we apply the Universal PaceMaker (UPM) model to investigate changes in DNA methylation during aging. The UPM was initially developed to study rate acceleration/deceleration in sequence evolution. Rather than identifying which linear combinations of sites predicts age, the UPM models the rates of change of multiple CpG sites, as well as their starting methylation levels, and estimates the age of each individual to optimize the model fit. We refer to the estimated age as the "epigenetic age", which is in contrast to the known chronological age of each individual. We construct a statistical framework and devise an algorithm to determine whether a genomic pacemaker is in effect (i.e rates of change vary with age). The decision is made by comparing two competing likelihood based models, the molecular clock (MC) and UPM. For the molecular clock model, we use the known chronological age of each individual and fit the methylation rates at multiple sites, and express the problem as a linear least squares and solve it in polynomial time. For the UPM case, the search space is larger as we are fitting both the epigenetic age of each individual as well as the rates for each site, yet we succeed to reduce the problem to the space of individuals and polynomial in the more significant space-the methylated sites. We first tested our algorithm on simulated data to elucidate the factors affecting the identification of the pacemaker model. We find that, provided with enough data, our algorithm is capable of identifying a pacemaker even when a weak signal is present in the data. Based on these results, we applied our method to DNA methylation data from human blood from individuals of various ages. Although the improvement in variance across sites between the UPM and MC was small, the results suggest that the existence of a pacemaker is highly significant. The PaceMaker results also suggest a decay in the rate of change in DNA methylation with age.},

abstract = {Recent discoveries are redefining our view of cellular senescence as a trigger of tissue remodelling that acts during normal embryonic development and upon tissue damage. To achieve this, senescent cells arrest their own proliferation, recruit phagocytic immune cells and promote tissue renewal. This sequence of events - senescence, followed by clearance and then regeneration - may not be efficiently completed in aged tissues or in pathological contexts, thereby resulting in the accumulation of senescent cells. Increasing evidence indicates that both pro-senescent therapies and antisenescent therapies can be beneficial. In cancer and during active tissue repair, pro-senescent therapies contribute to minimize the damage by limiting proliferation and fibrosis, respectively. Conversely, antisenescent therapies may help to eliminate accumulated senescent cells and to recover tissue function.},

abstract = {We have found that mutations in the gene daf-2 can cause fertile, active, adult Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodites to live more than twice as long as wild type. This lifespan extension, the largest yet reported in any organism, requires the activity of a second gene, daf-16. Both genes also regulate formation of the dauer larva, a developmentally arrested larval form that is induced by crowding and starvation and is very long-lived. Our findings raise the possibility that the longevity of the dauer is not simply a consequence of its arrested growth, but instead results from a regulated lifespan extension mechanism that can be uncoupled from other aspects of dauer formation. daf-2 and daf-16 provide entry points into understanding how lifespan can be extended.},

abstract = {Epidemiological studies and experimental models show that maternal nutritional constraint during pregnancy alters the metabolic phenotype of the offspring and that this can be passed to subsequent generations. In the rat, induction of an altered metabolic phenotype in the liver of the F 1 generation by feeding a protein-restricted diet (PRD) during pregnancy involves the altered methylation of specific gene promoters. We therefore investigated whether the altered methylation of PPAR$\alpha$ and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) promoters was passed to the F 2 generation. Females rats (F 0 ) were fed a reference diet (180 g/kg protein) or PRD (90 g/kg protein) throughout gestation, and AIN-76A during lactation. The F 1 offspring were weaned onto AIN-76A. F 1 females were mated and fed AIN-76A throughout pregnancy and lactation. F 1 and F 2 males were killed on postnatal day 80. Hepatic PPAR$\alpha$ and GR promoter methylation was significantly ( P {\textless} 0{\textperiodcentered}05) lower in the PRD group in the F 1 (PPAR$\alpha$ 8 {\%}, GR 10 {\%}) and F 2 (PPAR$\alpha$ 11 {\%}, GR 8 {\%}) generations. There were trends ( P {\textless} 0{\textperiodcentered}1) towards a higher expression of PPAR$\alpha$, GR, acyl-CoA oxidase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) in the F 1 and F 2 males, although this was significant only for PEPCK. These data show for the first time that the altered methylation of gene promoters induced in the F 1 generation by maternal protein restriction during pregnancy is transmitted to the F 2 generation. This may represent a mechanism for the transmission of induced phenotypes between generations.},

abstract = {Epigenetic mechanisms play an important role in the tissue-specific regulation of gene expression. This study analyzed the relationship between tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (ALPL) gene expression and the methylation of a CpG island located in its proximal region. Gene expression was analyzed by real time RT-qPCR in primary human osteoblasts (hOBs), the osteoblastic cell line MG-63, the mammary cell line MCF-7, and bone tissue. DNA methylation was analyzed by qMSP in those cells and also in lining osteoblasts and in osteocytes obtained from human bone samples by laser-assisted capture. hOBs expressed much more ALPL mRNA than MG-63 cells (7.3 ± 3.2 vs. 0.2 ± 0.1 arbitrary units, respectively). hOBs showed a very weak DNA methylation ({\textless}10{\%}), whereas MG-63 had a higher degree of methylation (58 ± 6{\%}). Likewise, MCF-7 cells, which scarcely expressed ALPL, had a hypermethylated CpG island. Thus, the degree of methylation in the CpG island was inversely associated with the transcriptional levels of ALPL in the studied cells. Furthermore, treatment with the DNA demethylating agent AzadC induced a 30-fold increase in ALPL expression, in MG-63 cells, accompanied by a parallel increase in alkaline phosphatase activity. However, AzadC did not affect ALPL levels in the already hypomethylated hOBs. In addition, in microdissected osteocytes, which do not express alkaline phosphatase, the CpG island was highly methylated ({\textgreater}90{\%}), whereas lining osteoblasts showed an intermediate degree of methylation (58 ± 13{\%}). These results suggest an important role of DNA methylation in the regulation of ALPL expression through the osteoblast-osteocyte transition. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Accumulating evidence suggests that E3 ubiquitin ligases play important roles in cancer development. In this article, we provide a comprehensive summary of the roles of the Nedd4-like family of E3 ubiquitin ligases in human cancer. There are nine members of the Nedd4-like E3 family, all of which share a similar structure, including a C2 domain at the N-terminus, two to four WW domains in the middle of the protein, and a homologous to E6-AP COOH terminus domain at the C-terminus. The assertion that Nedd4-like E3s play a role in cancer is supported by the overexpression of Smurf2 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, WWP1 in prostate and breast cancer, Nedd4 in prostate and bladder cancer, and Smurf1 in pancreatic cancer. Because Nedd4-like E3s regulate ubiquitin-mediated trafficking, lysosomal or proteasomal degradation, and nuclear translocation of multiple proteins, they modulate important signaling pathways involved in tumorigenesis like TGFbeta, EGF, IGF, VEGF, SDF-1, and TNFalpha. Additionally, several Nedd4-like E3s directly regulate various cancer-related transcription factors from the Smad, p53, KLF, RUNX, and Jun families. Interestingly, multiple Nedd4-like E3s show ligase independent function. Furthermore, Nedd4-like E3s themselves are frequently regulated by phosphorylation, ubiquitination, translocation, and transcription in cancer cells. Because the regulation and biological output of these E3s is such a complex process, study of the role of these E3s in cancer development poses some challenges. However, understanding the oncogenic potential of these E3s may facilitate the identification and development of biomarkers and drug targets in human cancer.},

@article{McEwen2018,
abstract = {BACKGROUND The capacity of technologies measuring DNA methylation (DNAm) is rapidly evolving, as are the options for applicable bioinformatics methods. The most commonly used DNAm microarray, the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 (450K array), has recently been replaced by the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC (EPIC array), nearly doubling the number of targeted CpG sites. Given that a subset of 450K CpG sites is absent on the EPIC array and that several tools for both data normalization and analyses were developed on the 450K array, it is important to assess their utility when applied to EPIC array data. One of the most commonly used 450K tools is the pan-tissue epigenetic clock, a multivariate predictor of biological age based on DNAm at 353 CpG sites. Of these CpGs, 19 are missing from the EPIC array, thus raising the question of whether EPIC data can be used to accurately estimate DNAm age. We also investigated a 71-CpG epigenetic age predictor, referred to as the Hannum method, which lacks 6 probes on the EPIC array. To evaluate these epigenetic clocks in EPIC data properly, a prior assessment of the effects of data preprocessing methods on DNAm age is also required. METHODS DNAm was quantified, on both the 450K and EPIC platforms, from human primary monocytes derived from 172 individuals. We calculated DNAm age from raw, and three different preprocessed data forms to assess the effects of different processing methods on the DNAm age estimate. Using an additional cohort, we also investigated DNAm age of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, bronchoalveolar lavage, and bronchial brushing samples using the EPIC array. RESULTS Using monocyte-derived data from subjects on both the 450K and EPIC, we found that DNAm age was highly correlated across both raw and preprocessing methods (r {\textgreater} 0.91). Thus, the correlation between chronological age and the DNAm age estimate is largely unaffected by platform differences and normalization methods. However, we found that the choice of normalization method and measurement platform can lead to a systematic offset in the age estimate which in turn leads to an increase in the median error. Comparing the 450K and EPIC DNAm age estimates, we observed that the median absolute difference was 1.44-3.10 years across preprocessing methods. CONCLUSIONS Here, we have provided evidence that the epigenetic clock is resistant to the lack of 19 CpG sites missing from the EPIC array as well as highlighted the importance of considering the technical variance of the epigenetic when interpreting group differences below the reported error. Furthermore, our study highlights the utility of epigenetic age acceleration measure, the residuals from a linear regression of DNAm age on chronological age, as the resulting values are robust with respect to normalization methods and measurement platforms.},

abstract = {Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) hold promise for gene-specific knockdown in diseases that involve RNA or protein gain-of-function effects. In the hereditary degenerative disease myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), transcripts from the mutant allele contain an expanded CUG repeat and are retained in the nucleus. The mutant RNA exerts a toxic gain-of-function effect, making it an appropriate target for therapeutic ASOs. However, despite improvements in ASO chemistry and design, systemic use of ASOs is limited because uptake in many tissues, including skeletal and cardiac muscle, is not sufficient to silence target messenger RNAs. Here we show that nuclear-retained transcripts containing expanded CUG (CUG(exp)) repeats are unusually sensitive to antisense silencing. In a transgenic mouse model of DM1, systemic administration of ASOs caused a rapid knockdown of CUG(exp) RNA in skeletal muscle, correcting the physiological, histopathologic and transcriptomic features of the disease. The effect was sustained for up to 1 year after treatment was discontinued. Systemically administered ASOs were also effective for muscle knockdown of Malat1, a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that is retained in the nucleus. These results provide a general strategy to correct RNA gain-of-function effects and to modulate the expression of expanded repeats, lncRNAs and other transcripts with prolonged nuclear residence.},

abstract = {The five muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M(1)-M(5)) are prototypical members of the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). During the past decade, this laboratory has used different members of this receptor subfamily as model systems to study the molecular mechanisms involved in GPCR function. This article reviews recent investigations dealing with molecular aspects of M(3) muscarinic receptor assembly and dimerization/oligomerization. Studies with coexpressed M(3) receptor fragments and M(3) muscarinic/alpha(2C)-adrenergic hybrid receptors showed that muscarinic receptors, like other GPCRs, are composed of multiple autonomous folding domains. Moreover, biochemical studies have provided direct evidence for the formation of M(3) receptor dimers/oligomers. These high molecular mass receptor species are expressed on the cell surface and can bind muscarinic ligands. M(3) receptor dimerization/oligomerization appears to be receptor subtype-selective and involves both non-covalent interactions as well as disulfide-crosslinking of receptor monomers. These studies add to the growing number of reports suggesting the existence of GPCR dimers or multimers. The precise functional characteristics of such receptor aggregates remain to be elucidated.},

MapSplice is not dependent on splice site features or intron length, consequently it can detect novel canonical as well as non-canonical splices. MapSplice leverages the quality and diversity of read alignments of a given splice to increase accuracy. We demonstrate that MapSplice achieves higher sensitivity and specificity than TopHat and SpliceMap on a set of simulated RNA-seq data. Experimental studies also support the accuracy of the algorithm. Splice junctions derived from eight breast cancer RNA-seq datasets recapitulated the extensiveness of alternative splicing on a global level as well as the differences between molecular subtypes of breast cancer. These combined results indicate that MapSplice is a highly accurate algorithm for the alignment of RNA-seq reads to splice junctions.

abstract = {Although epigenetic processes have been linked to aging and disease in other systems, it is not yet known whether they relate to reproductive aging. Recently, we developed a highly accurate epigenetic biomarker of age (known as the "epigenetic clock"), which is based on DNA methylation levels. Here we carry out an epigenetic clock analysis of blood, saliva, and buccal epithelium using data from four large studies: the Women's Health Initiative (n = 1,864); Invecchiare nel Chianti (n = 200); Parkinson's disease, Environment, and Genes (n = 256); and the United Kingdom Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development (n = 790). We find that increased epigenetic age acceleration in blood is significantly associated with earlier menopause (P = 0.00091), bilateral oophorectomy (P = 0.0018), and a longer time since menopause (P = 0.017). Conversely, epigenetic age acceleration in buccal epithelium and saliva do not relate to age at menopause; however, a higher epigenetic age in saliva is exhibited in women who undergo bilateral oophorectomy (P = 0.0079), while a lower epigenetic age in buccal epithelium was found for womenwho underwentmenopausal hormone therapy (P = 0.00078). Using genetic data, we find evidence of coheritability between age at menopause and epigenetic age acceleration in blood. Using Mendelian randomization analysis, we find that two SNPs that are highly associated with age at menopause exhibit a significant association with epigenetic age acceleration. Overall, our Mendelian randomization approach and other lines of evidence suggest that menopause accelerates epigenetic aging of blood, but mechanistic studieswill be needed to dissect cause-and-effect relationships further.},

abstract = {The ternary Cas9-crRNA-tracrRNA complex (Cas9t) of the Type II CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas (CRISPR-associated) system functions as an Mg2+-dependent RNA-directed DNA endonuclease that locates its DNA target guided by the crRNA (CRISPR RNA) in the tracrRNA-crRNA structure and introduces a double-strand break at a specific site in DNA. The simple modular organization of Cas9t, where specificity for the DNA target is encoded by a small crRNA and the cleavage reaction is executed by the Cas9 endonuclease, provides a versatile platform for the engineering of universal RNA-directed DNA endonucleases. By altering the crRNA sequence within the Cas9t complex, programmable endonucleases can be designed for both in vitro and in vivo applications. Cas9t has been recently employed as a gene-editing tool in various eukaryotic cell types. Using Streptococcus thermophilus Cas9t as a model system, we demonstrate the feasibility of Cas9t as a programmable molecular tool for in vitro DNA manipulations.},

abstract = {There is considerable evidence for the induction of different phenotypes by variations in the early life environment, including nutrition, which in man is associated with a graded risk of metabolic disease; fetal programming. It is likely that the induction of persistent changes to tissue structure and function by differences in the early life environment involves life-long alterations to the regulation of gene transcription. This view is supported by both studies of human subjects and animal models. The mechanism which underlies such changes to gene expression is now beginning to be understood. In the present review we discuss the role of changes in the epigenetic regulation of transcription, specifically DNA methylation and covalent modification of histones, in the induction of an altered phenotype by nutritional constraint in early life. The demonstration of altered epigenetic regulation of genes in phenotype induction suggests the possibility of interventions to modify long-term disease risk associated with unbalanced nutrition in early life.},

@article{Agris2007,
abstract = {The genetic code is degenerate, in that 20 amino acids are encoded by 61 triplet codes. In 1966, Francis Crick hypothesized that the cell's limited number of tRNAs decoded the genome by recognizing more than one codon. The ambiguity of that recognition resided in the third base-pair, giving rise to the Wobble Hypothesis. Post-transcriptional modifications at tRNA's wobble position 34, especially modifications of uridine 34, enable wobble to occur. The Modified Wobble Hypothesis proposed in 1991 that specific modifications of a tRNA wobble nucleoside shape the anticodon architecture in such a manner that interactions were restricted to the complementary base plus a single wobble pairing for amino acids with twofold degenerate codons. However, chemically different modifications at position 34 would expand the ability of a tRNA to read three or even four of the fourfold degenerate codons. One foundation of Crick's Wobble Hypothesis was that a near-constant geometry of canonical base-pairing be maintained in forming all three base-pairs between the tRNA anticodon and mRNA codon on the ribosome. In accepting an aminoacyl-tRNA, the ribosome requires maintenance of a specific geometry for the anticodon-codon base-pairing. However, it is the post-transcriptional modifications at tRNA wobble position 34 and purine 37, 3'-adjacent to the anticodon, that pre-structure the anticodon domain to ensure the correct codon binding. The modifications create both the architecture and the stability needed for decoding through restraints on anticodon stereochemistry and conformational space, and through selective hydrogen bonding. A physicochemical understanding of modified nucleoside contributions to the tRNA anticodon domain architecture and its decoding of the genome has advanced RNA world evolutionary theory, the principles of RNA chemistry, and the application of this knowledge to the introduction of new amino acids to proteins.},

abstract = {We describe a bacterial two-hybrid system that allows an easy in vivo screening and selection of functional interactions between two proteins. This genetic test is based on the reconstitution, in an Escherichia coli cya strain, of a signal transduction pathway that takes advantage of the positive control exerted by cAMP. Two putative interacting proteins are genetically fused to two complementary fragments, T25 and T18, that constitute the catalytic domain of Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase. Association of the two-hybrid proteins results in functional complementation between T25 and T18 fragments and leads to cAMP synthesis. Cyclic AMP then triggers transcriptional activation of catabolic operons, such as lactose or maltose, that yield a characteristic phenotype. In this genetic test, the involvement of a signaling cascade offers the unique property that association between the hybrid proteins can be spatially separated from the transcriptional activation readout. This permits a versatile design of screening procedures either for ligands that bind to a given "bait," as in the classical yeast two-hybrid system, or for molecules or mutations that block a given interaction between two proteins of interest.},

abstract = {With few exceptions, current methods for short read mapping make use of simple seed heuristics to speed up the search. Most of the underlying matching models neglect the necessity to allow not only mismatches, but also insertions and deletions. Current evaluations indicate, however, that very different error models apply to the novel high-throughput sequencing methods. While the most frequent error-type in Illumina reads are mismatches, reads produced by 454's GS FLX predominantly contain insertions and deletions (indels). Even though 454 sequencers are able to produce longer reads, the method is frequently applied to small RNA (miRNA and siRNA) sequencing. Fast and accurate matching in particular of short reads with diverse errors is therefore a pressing practical problem. We introduce a matching model for short reads that can, besides mismatches, also cope with indels. It addresses different error models. For example, it can handle the problem of leading and trailing contaminations caused by primers and poly-A tails in transcriptomics or the length-dependent increase of error rates. In these contexts, it thus simplifies the tedious and error-prone trimming step. For efficient searches, our method utilizes index structures in the form of enhanced suffix arrays. In a comparison with current methods for short read mapping, the presented approach shows significantly increased performance not only for 454 reads, but also for Illumina reads. Our approach is implemented in the software segemehl available at http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/segemehl/.},

abstract = {Background Vitamin D is crucial for maintenance of musculoskeletal health, and might also have a role in extraskeletal tissues. Determinants of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations include sun exposure and diet, but high heritability suggests that genetic factors could also play a part. We aimed to identify common genetic variants affecting vitamin D concentrations and risk of insufficiency. Methods We undertook a genome-wide association study of 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations in 33 996 individuals of European descent from 15 cohorts. Five epidemiological cohorts were designated as discovery cohorts (n=16 125), five as in-silico replication cohorts (n=9367), and five as de-novo replication cohorts (n=8504). 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay, chemiluminescent assay, ELISA, or mass spectrometry. Vitamin D insufficiency was defined as concentrations lower than 75 nmol/L or 50 nmol/L. We combined results of genome-wide analyses across cohorts using Z-score-weighted meta-analysis. Genotype scores were constructed for confirmed variants. Findings Variants at three loci reached genome-wide significance in discovery cohorts for association with 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations, and were confirmed in replication cohorts: 4p12 (overall p=1{\textperiodcentered}9×10-109for rs2282679, in GC); 11q12 (p=2{\textperiodcentered}1×10-27for rs12785878, near DHCR7); and 11p15 (p=3{\textperiodcentered}3×10-20for rs10741657, near CYP2R1). Variants at an additional locus (20q13, CYP24A1) were genome-wide significant in the pooled sample (p=6{\textperiodcentered}0×10-10for rs6013897). Participants with a genotype score (combining the three confirmed variants) in the highest quartile were at increased risk of having 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations lower than 75 nmol/L (OR 2{\textperiodcentered}47, 95{\%} CI 2{\textperiodcentered}20-2{\textperiodcentered}78, p= 2{\textperiodcentered}3×10-48) or lower than 50 nmol/L (1{\textperiodcentered}92, 1{\textperiodcentered}70-2{\textperiodcentered}16, p=1{\textperiodcentered}0×10-26) compared with those in the lowest quartile. Interpretation Variants near genes involved in cholesterol synthesis, hydroxylation, and vitamin D transport affect vitamin D status. Genetic variation at these loci identifies individuals who have substantially raised risk of vitamin D insufficiency. Funding Full funding sources listed at end of paper (see Acknowledgments). ].},

The recent discovery that FTO, an obesity risk gene, encodes an m6A demethylase implicates m6A as an important regulator of physiological processes. Here, we present a method for transcriptome-wide m6A localization, which combines m 6A-specific methylated RNA immunoprecipitation with next-generation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq). We use this method to identify mRNAs of 7,676 mammalian genes that contain m6A, indicating that m6A is a common base modification of mRNA. The m6A modification exhibits tissue-specific regulation and is markedly increased throughout brain development. We find that m6A sites are enriched near stop codons and in 3′ UTRs, and we uncover an association between m6A residues and microRNA-binding sites within 3′ UTRs. These findings provide a resource for identifying transcripts that are substrates for adenosine methylation and reveal insights into the epigenetic regulation of the mammalian transcriptome. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

These represent CpG-poor distal regulatory regions as evidenced by location, DNase I hypersensitivity, presence of enhancer chromatin marks and enhancer activity in reporter assays. LMRs are occupied by DNA-binding factors and their binding is necessary and sufficient to create LMRs. A comparison of neuronal and stem-cell methylomes confirms this dependency, as cell-type-specific LMRs are occupied by cell-type-specific transcription factors. This study provides methylome references for the mouse and shows that DNA-binding factors locally influence DNA methylation, enabling the identification of active regulatory regions.},

Over 25{\%} of CpG dinucleotides in the human genome reside within Alu elements, the most abundant human repeats. The methylation of Alu elements is an important mechanism to suppress Alu transcription and subsequent retrotransposition. Decades of studies revealed that Alu methylation is highly dynamic during early development and aging. Recently, many environmental factors were shown to have a great impact on Alu methylation. In addition, aberrant Alu methylation has been documented to be an early event in many tumors and Alu methylation levels have been associated with tumor aggressiveness. The assessment of the Alu methylation has become an important approach for early diagnosis and/or prognosis of cancer. This review focuses on the dynamic Alu methylation during development, aging, and tumor genesis. The cause and consequence of Alu methylation changes will be discussed.},

On division of the country into two hundred and twelve local authority areas a strong geographical relation was found between ischaemic heart disease mortality rates in 1968-78 and infant mortality in 1921-25. Of the twenty-four other common causes of death only bronchitis, stomach cancer, and rheumatic heart disease were similarly related to infant mortality. These diseases are associated with poor living conditions and mortality from them is declining. Ischaemic heart disease is strongly correlated with both neonatal and postneonatal mortality.

Understanding the relative influence of each of these factors may help identify important preventive treatments and provide new ways to identify women at risk for osteoporosis. In this analysis we utilize a computer model of the bone remodeling process to predict the relative influences of peak BMD, menopause and age-related bone loss on the development of osteoporosis. The delay in the onset of osteoporosis (defined as BMD {\textless} 2.5 SD from the young adult mean) caused by modifying, peak BMD, age-related bone loss or the age at menopause is quantified. A 10{\%} increase in peak BMD is predicted to delay the development of osteoporosis by 13 years, while a 10{\%} change in the age at menopause or the rate of non-menopausal bone loss is predicted to delay osteoporosis by approximately 2 years, suggesting that peak BMD may be the single most important factor in the development of the disease.},

abstract = {Understanding how the epigenome deteriorates with age and subsequently impacts on biological function may bring unique insights to ageing-related disease mechanisms. As a central cellular apparatus, tRNAs are fundamental to the information flow from DNA to proteins. Whilst only being transcribed from {\~{}}46kb ({\textless}0.002{\%}) of the human genome, their transcripts are the second most abundant in the cell. Furthermore, it is now increasingly recognised that tRNAs and their fragments also have complex regulatory functions. In both their core translational and additional regulatory roles, tRNAs are intimately involved in the control of metabolic processes known to affect ageing. Experimentally DNA methylation can alter tRNA expression, but little is known about the genomic DNA methylation state of tRNAs. Here, we find that the human genomic tRNA loci (610 tRNA genes termed the tRNAome) are enriched for ageing-related DNA hypermethylation. We initially identified DNA hypermethylation of 44 and 21 specific tRNA genes, at study-wide (p {\textless} 4.34e-9) and genome-wide (p {\textless} 4.34e-9) significance, respectively, in 4,350 MeDIP-seq peripheral blood DNA methylomes (16 - 82 years). This starkly contrasted with 0 hypomethylated at both these significance levels. Further analysing the 21 genome-wide results, we found 3 of these tRNAs to be independent of major changes in cell-type composition (tRNA-iMet-CAT-1-4, tRNA-Ser-AGA-2-6, tRNA-Ile-AAT-4-1). We also excluded the ageing-related changes being due to the inherent CpG density of the tRNAome by permutation analysis (1,000x, Empirical p-value {\textless} 1e-3). We additionally explored 79 tRNA loci in an independent cohort using Fluidigm deep targeted bisulfite-sequencing of pooled DNA (n=190) across a range of 4 timepoints (aged {\~{}}4, {\~{}}28, {\~{}}63, {\~{}}78 years). This revealed these ageing changes to be specific to particular isodecoder copies of these tRNA (tRNAs coding for the same amino acid but with sequence body differences) and included replication of 2 of the 3 genome-wide tRNAs. Additionally, this isodecoder-specificity may indicate the potential for regulatory fragment changes with age. In this study we provide the first comprehensive evaluation at the genomic DNA methylation state of the human tRNAome, revealing a discreet and strongly directional hypermethylation with advancing age.},

abstract = {{\{}tRNA{\}}-derived fragments ({\{}tRFs{\}}) are a class of potent regulatory {\{}RNAs{\}}. We mined the datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas representing 32 cancer types with a deterministic and exhaustive pipeline for {\{}tRNA{\}} fragments. We found that mitochondrial {\{}tRNAs{\}} contribute disproportionally more {\{}tRFs{\}} than the nuclear ones. Through integrative analyses, we uncovered a multitude of statistically significant and context-dependent associations between the identified {\{}tRFs{\}} and {\{}mRNAs{\}}. In many of the 32 cancer types, these associations involve {\{}mRNAs{\}} from developmental processes, receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, the proteasome, and metabolic pathways that include glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and {\{}ATP{\}} synthesis. Even though the pathways are common to multiple cancers, the association of specific {\{}mRNAs{\}} with {\{}tRFs{\}} depend on and differ from cancer to cancer. The associations between {\{}tRFs{\}} and {\{}mRNAs{\}} extend to genomic properties as well: specifically, {\{}tRFs{\}} are positively correlated with shorter genes that have a higher density in repeats, such as {\{}ALUs{\}}, {\{}MIRs{\}}, and {\{}ERVLs{\}}. Conversely, {\{}tRFs{\}} are negatively correlated with longer genes that have a lower repeat density, suggesting a possible dichotomy between cell proliferation and differentiation. Analyses of bladder, lung, and kidney cancer data indicate that the {\{}tRF{\}}-{\{}mRNA{\}} wiring can also depend on a patient's sex; sex-dependent associations involve cyclin-dependent kinases in bladder cancer, the {\{}MAPK{\}} signaling pathway in lung cancer, and purine metabolism in kidney cancer. Taken together, these findings suggest diverse and wide-ranging roles for {\{}tRFs{\}} and highlight the extensive interconnections of {\{}tRFs{\}} with key cellular processes and human genomic architecture.

To clarify the possible physiological or pathological relevance of ABCG2 polymorphisms, we have functionally validated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of ABCG2. In the present study, based on the currently available data on SNPs and acquired mutations, we have created a total of 18 variant forms of ABCG2 (V12M, G51C, Q126stop, Q141K, T153M, Q166E, I206L, F208S, S248P, E334stop, F431L, S441N, R482G, R482T, F489L, F571I, N590Y, and D620N) by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed them in insect cells. Because porphyrins are considered to be endogenous substrates for ABCG2, we have investigated the porphyrin transport activity of those variant forms in vitro. We herein provide evidence that the variants Q126stop, F208S, S248P, E334stop, and S441N are defective in porphyrin transport, whereas F489L exhibited impaired transport, approximately 10{\%} of the activity observed for the wild type. Furthermore, Flp-In-293 cells expressing those variants were photosensitive. Thus, among those genetic polymorphisms of ABCG2, at least the hitherto validated alleles of Q126stop, S441N, and F489L are suggested to be of clinical importance related to the potential risk of porphyria.},

Removal of harmful protein aggregates is mediated by autophagy, a mechanism by which the cell sequesters cytosolic cargo and delivers it for degradation by the lysosome. Identification of autophagy receptors, such as p62/SQSTM1 and NBR1, which simultaneously bind both ubiquitin and autophagy-specific ubiquitin-like modifiers, LC3/GABARAP, has provided a molecular link between ubiquitination and autophagy.

As yet little is known about the contribution of various DNA repair pathways to prevent mutagenesis. Using the C. elegans model we analyse mutational spectra that arise in wild-type and 61 DNA repair and DNA damage response mutants cultivated over multiple generations. Overall, 44{\%} of lines show {\textgreater}2-fold increased mutagenesis with a broad spectrum of mutational outcomes including changes in single or multiple types of base substitutions induced by defects in base excision or nucleotide excision repair, or elevated levels of 50-400 bp deletions in translesion polymerase mutants rev-3 (pol $\zeta$) and polh-1 (pol $\eta$). Mutational signatures associated with defective homologous recombination fall into two classes: 1) mutants lacking brc-1/BRCA1 or rad-51 /RAD51 paralogs show elevated base substitutions, indels and structural variants, while 2) deficiency for MUS-81/MUS81 and SLX-1/SLX1 nucleases, and HIM-6/BLM, HELQ-1/HELQ and RTEL-1/RTEL1 helicases primarily cause structural variants. Genome-wide investigation of mutagenesis patterns identified elevated rates of tandem duplications often associated with inverted repeats in helq-1 mutants, and a unique pattern of ‘translocation' events involving homeologous sequences in rip-1 paralog mutants. atm-1/ ATM DNA damage checkpoint mutants harboured complex structural variants enriched in subtelomeric regions, and chromosome end-to-end fusions. Finally, while inactivation of the p53 -like gene cep-1 did not affect mutagenesis, combined brc-1 cep-1 deficiency displayed increased, locally clustered mutagenesis. In summary, we provide a global view of how DNA repair pathways prevent germ cell mutagenesis.},

To explore circRNAs systematically, we sequenced and computationally analysed human, mouse and nematode RNA. We detected thousands of well-expressed, stable circRNAs, often showing tissue/developmental-stage-specific expression. Sequence analysis indicated important regulatory functions for circRNAs. We found that a human circRNA, antisense to the cerebellar degeneration-related protein 1 transcript (CDR1as), is densely bound by microRNA (miRNA) effector complexes and harbours 63 conserved binding sites for the ancient miRNA miR-7. Further analyses indicated that CDR1as functions to bind miR-7 in neuronal tissues. Human CDR1as expression in zebrafish impaired midbrain development, similar to knocking down miR-7, suggesting that CDR1as is a miRNA antagonist with a miRNA-binding capacity ten times higher than any other known transcript. Together, our data provide evidence that circRNAs form a large class of post-transcriptional regulators. Numerous circRNAs form by head-to-tail splicing of exons, suggesting previously unrecognized regulatory potential of coding sequences.},

abstract = {Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has turned from a new and experimental technology into a standard procedure for cancer genome studies and clinical investigation. While a multitude of software packages for cancer genome data analysis have been made available, these need to be combined into efficient analytical workflows that cover multiple aspects relevant to a clinical environment and that deliver handy results within a reasonable time frame. Here, we introduce QuickNGS Cancer as a new suite of bioinformatics pipelines that is focused on cancer genomics and significantly reduces the analytical hurdles that still limit a broader applicability of NGS technology, particularly to clinically driven research. QuickNGS Cancer allows a highly efficient analysis of a broad variety of NGS data types, specifically considering cancer-specific issues, such as biases introduced by tumor impurity and aneuploidy or the assessment of genomic variations regarding their biomedical relevance. It delivers highly reproducible analysis results ready for interpretation within only a few days after sequencing, as shown by a reanalysis of 140 tumor/normal pairs from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) in which QuickNGS Cancer detected a significant number of mutations in key cancer genes missed by a well-established mutation calling pipeline. Finally, QuickNGS Cancer obtained several unexpected mutations in leukemias that could be confirmed by Sanger sequencing.},

abstract = {DNA methylation age (DNAm age; "epigenetic clock") has recently been described as highly correlated with chronological age. Several studies suggest that DNAm age reflects, at least in part, biological age. Here, we adapted a recently published methylation-sensitive single nucleotide primer extension method for epigenetic age estimation and calculated the DNAm age based on only seven cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites in 1,895 DNA samples of the Berlin Aging Study II. In a second step, we explored the relationship between this new potential measure of biological age with an established marker of biological age, relative leukocyte telomere length (rLTL), in the same cohort. Our results showed a positive and significant correlation between DNAm age estimation and chronological age (N = 1,895, Rs2 =.47), which persisted after adjustment for covariates (sex, leukocyte distribution, alcohol and smoking). We found a significant but weak negative association between DNAm age acceleration and rLTL in linear regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, alcohol and smoking ($\beta$ = {\^{a}} '0.002, p =.007). Therefore, DNAm age appears to be a promising biomarker in the analysis of phenotypes of aging, which are not (only) related to pathways associated with mitotic age as measured by rLTL.},

abstract = {Topologically associating domains (TADs) are fundamental structural and functional building blocks of human interphase chromosomes, yet the mechanisms of TAD formation remain unclear. Here, we propose that loop extrusion underlies TAD formation. In this process, cis-acting loop-extruding factors, likely cohesins, form progressively larger loops but stall at TAD boundaries due to interactions with boundary proteins, including CTCF. Using polymer simulations, we show that this model produces TADs and finer-scale features of Hi-C data. Each TAD emerges from multiple loops dynamically formed through extrusion, contrary to typical illustrations of single static loops. Loop extrusion both explains diverse experimental observations-including the preferential orientation of CTCF motifs, enrichments of architectural proteins at TAD boundaries, and boundary deletion experiments-and makes specific predictions for the depletion of CTCF versus cohesin. Finally, loop extrusion has potentially far-ranging consequences for processes such as enhancer-promoter interactions, orientation-specific chromosomal looping, and compaction of mitotic chromosomes.},

abstract = {mRNA translation decodes nucleotide into amino acid sequences. However, translation has also been shown to affect mRNA stability depending on codon composition in model organisms, although universality of this mechanism remains unclear. Here, using three independent approaches to measure exogenous and endogenous mRNA decay, we define which codons are associated with stable or unstable mRNAs in human cells. We demonstrate that the regulatory information affecting mRNA stability is encoded in codons and not in nucleotides. Stabilizing codons tend to be associated with higher tRNA levels and higher charged/total tRNA ratios. While mRNAs enriched in destabilizing codons tend to possess shorter poly(A)-tails, the poly(A)-tail is not required for the codon-mediated mRNA stability. This mechanism depends on translation; however, the number of ribosome loads into a mRNA modulates the codon-mediated effects on gene expression. This work provides definitive evidence that translation strongly affects mRNA stability in a codon-dependent manner in human cells.},

Here we describe the results of a community-wide benchmarking study comparing the performance of all widely used methods for DNA methylation analysis that are compatible with routine clinical use. We shipped 32 reference samples to 18 laboratories in seven different countries. Researchers in those laboratories collectively contributed 21 locus-specific assays for an average of 27 predefined genomic regions, as well as six global assays. We evaluated assay sensitivity on low-input samples and assessed the assays' ability to discriminate between cell types. Good agreement was observed across all tested methods, with amplicon bisulfite sequencing and bisulfite pyrosequencing showing the best all-round performance. Our technology comparison can inform the selection, optimization and use of DNA methylation assays in large-scale validation studies, biomarker development and clinical diagnostics.},

abstract = {The choreography of restriction endonuclease catalysis is a long-standing paradigm in molecular biology. Bivalent metal ions are required almost for all PD..D/ExK type enzymes, but the number of cofactors essential for the DNA backbone scission remained ambiguous. On the basis of crystal structures and biochemical data for various restriction enzymes, three models have been developed that assign critical roles for one, two, or three metal ions during the phosphodiester hydrolysis. To resolve this apparent controversy, we investigated the mechanism of BamHI catalysis using quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical simulation techniques and determined the activation barriers of three possible pathways that involve a Glu-113 or a neighboring water molecule as a general base or an external nucleophile that penetrated from bulk solution. The extrinsic mechanism was found to be the most favorable with an activation free energy of 23.4 kcal/mol, in reasonable agreement with the experimental data. On the basis of the effect of the individual metal ions on the activation barrier, metal ion A was concluded to be pivotal for the reaction, while the enzyme lacking metal ion B still has moderate efficiency. Thus, we propose that the catalytic scheme of BamHI does not involve a general base for nucleophile generation and requires one obligatory metal ion for catalysis that stabilizes the attacking nucleophile and coordinates it throughout the nucleophilic attack. Such a model may also explain the variation in the number of metal ions in the crystal structures and thus could serve as a framework for a unified catalytic scheme of type II restriction endonucleases.},

abstract = {As a lysosomal/vacuolar degradative pathway that is conserved in eukaryotic organisms, autophagy mediates the turnover of long-lived proteins and excess or aberrant organelles. The main characteristic of autophagy is the formation of a double-membrane vesicle, the autophagosome, which envelops part of the cytoplasm and delivers it to the lysosome/vacuole for breakdown and eventual recycling of the degradation products. Among the approximately 30 autophagy-related (Atg) genes identified so far, there are two ubiquitin-like proteins, Atg12 and Atg8. Analogous to ubiquitination, Atg12 is conjugated to Atg5 by Atg7--an E1-like protein--and Atg10--an E2-like protein. Similarly, Atg7 and Atg3 are the respective E1-like and E2-like proteins that mediate the conjugation of Atg8 to phosphatidylethanolamine. Both Atg12-Atg5 and Atg8 localize to the developing autophagosome. The Atg12-Atg5 conjugate facilitates the lipidation of Atg8 and directs its correct subcellular localization. Atg8-phosphatidylethanolamine is probably a scaffold protein that supports membrane expansion and the amount present correlates with the size of autophagosomes.},

Using the relatively simple bacterial models, first attempts have been made to introduce suitable metrics to describe the complexity of organism's signaling machinery, which included introducing the "bacterial IQ" score. Here, we use an updated census of prokaryotic signal transduction systems to improve this parameter and evaluate its consistency within selected bacterial phyla. We also introduce a more elaborate descriptor, a set of profiles of relative abundance of members of each family of signal transduction proteins encoded in each genome. We show that these family profiles are well conserved within each genus and are often consistent within families of bacteria. Thus, they reflect evolutionary relationships between organisms as well as individual adaptations of each organism to its specific ecological niche.},

Here we have identified a polymerase with reverse transcriptase activity (from Thermus thermophilus) that is selective by up to 18-fold for incorporation of thymidine opposite unmodified A over m(6)A. We show that the enzyme can be used to locate and quantify m(6)A in synthetic RNAs by analysis of pausing bands, and have used the enzyme in tandem with a nonselective polymerase to locate the presence and position of m(6)A in high-abundance cellular RNAs. By this approach we demonstrate that the long-undetermined position of m(6)A in mammalian 28S rRNA is nucleotide 4190.},

abstract = {We describe the identification and characterization of circular intronic long noncoding RNAs in human cells, which accumulate owing to a failure in debranching. The formation of such circular intronic RNAs (ciRNAs) can be recapitulated using expression vectors, and their processing depends on a consensus motif containing a 7 nt GU-rich element near the 5' splice site and an 11 nt C-rich element close to the branchpoint site. In addition, we show that ciRNAs are abundant in the nucleus and have little enrichment for microRNA target sites. Importantly, knockdown of ciRNAs led to the reduced expression of their parent genes. One abundant such RNA, ci-ankrd52, largely accumulates to its sites of transcription, associates with elongation Pol II machinery, and acts as a positive regulator of Pol II transcription. This study thus suggests a cis-regulatory role of noncoding intronic transcripts on their parent coding genes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Previous studies have indicated that physiological levels of dynamic mechanical strain produce rapid increases in nitric oxide (NO) release from rat ulna explants and primary cultures of osteoblast-like cells and embryonic chick osteocytes derived from long bones. To establish the mechanism by which loading-induced NO production may be regulated, we have examined: nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoform mRNA and protein expression, the effect of mechanical loading in vivo on NOS mRNA expression, and the effect of mechanical strain on NO production by bone cells in culture. Using Northern blot analyses, in situ hybridization, and immunocytochemistry we have established that the predominant NOS isoform expressed in rat long bone periosteal osteoblasts and in a distinct population of cortical bone osteocytes is the endothelial form of NOS (eNOS), with little or no expression of the inducible NOS or neuronal NOS isoforms. In contrast, in non–load-bearing calvariae there are no detectable levels of eNOS in osteocytes and little in osteoblasts. Consistent with these observations, ulnar explants release NO rapidly in response to loading in vitro, presumably through the activation of eNOS, whereas calvarial explants do not. The relative contribution of different bone cells to these rapid increases in strain-induced NO release was established by assessment of medium nitrite (stable NO metabolite) concentration, which showed that purified populations of osteocytes produce significantly greater quantities of NO per cell in response to mechanical strain than osteoblast-like cells derived from the same bones. Using Northern blot hybridization, we have also shown that neither a single nor five consecutive daily periods of in vivo mechanical loading produced any significant effect on different NOS isoform mRNA expression in rat ulnae. In conclusion, our results indicate that eNOS is the prevailing isoform expressed by cells of the osteoblast/osteocyte lineage and that strain produces increases in the activity of eNOS without apparently altering the levels of eNOS mRNA.},

abstract = {The role of epigenetics in the modulation of longevity has not been studied in humans. To this aim, (1) we evaluated the DNA methylation from peripheral leukocytes of 21 female centenarians, their 21 female offspring, 21 offspring of both non-long-lived parents, and 21 young women through ELISA assay, pyrosequencing analysis of Alu sequences, and quantification of methylation in CpG repeats outside CpG islands; (2) we compared the DNA methylation profiles of these populations through Infinium array for genome-wide CpG methylation analysis. We observed an age-related decrease in global DNA methylation and a delay of this process in centenarians' offspring. Interestingly, literature data suggest a link between the loss of DNA methylation observed during aging and the development of age-associated diseases. Genome-wide methylation analysis evidenced DNA methylation profiles specific for aging and longevity: (1) aging-associated DNA hypermethylation occurs predominantly in genes involved in the development of anatomical structures, organs, and multicellular organisms and in the regulation of transcription; (2) genes involved in nucleotide biosynthesis, metabolism, and control of signal transmission are differently methylated between centenarians' offspring and offspring of both non-long-lived parents, hypothesizing a role for these genes in human longevity. Our results suggest that a better preservation of DNA methylation status, a slower cell growing/metabolism, and a better control in signal transmission through epigenetic mechanisms may be involved in the process of human longevity. These data fit well with the observations related to the beneficial effects of mild hypothyroidism and insulin-like growth factor I system impairment on the modulation of human lifespan.},

abstract = {Removal of, or adjustment for, batch effects or center differences is generally required when such effects are present in data. In particular, when preparing microarray gene expression data from multiple cohorts, array platforms, or batches for later analyses, batch effects can have confounding effects, inducing spurious differences between study groups. Many methods and tools exist for removing batch effects from data. However, when study groups are not evenly distributed across batches, actual group differences may induce apparent batch differences, in which case batch adjustments may bias, usually deflate, group differences. Some tools therefore have the option of preserving the difference between study groups, e.g. using a two-way ANOVA model to simultaneously estimate both group and batch effects. Unfortunately, this approach may systematically induce incorrect group differences in downstream analyses when groups are distributed between the batches in an unbalanced manner. The scientific community seems to be largely unaware of how this approach may lead to false discoveries.},

Experimental data have been generated on a huge number of organisms, tissue types, treatment conditions and disease states. The Gene Expression Omnibus (Barrett et al., 2005), developed by the National Center for Bioinformatics (NCBI) at the National Institutes of Health is a repository of nearly 140,000 gene expression experiments. The BioConductor project (Gentleman et al., 2004) is an open-source and open-development software project built in the R statistical programming environment (R Development core Team, 2005) for the analysis and comprehension of genomic data. The tools contained in the BioConductor project represent many state-of-the-art methods for the analysis of microarray and genomics data. We have developed a software tool that allows access to the wealth of information within GEO directly from BioConductor, eliminating many the formatting and parsing problems that have made such analyses labor-intensive in the past. The software, called GEOquery, effectively establishes a bridge between GEO and BioConductor. Easy access to GEO data from BioConductor will likely lead to new analyses of GEO data using novel and rigorous statistical and bioinformatic tools. Facilitating analyses and meta-analyses of microarray data will increase the efficiency with which biologically important conclusions can be drawn from published genomic data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: GEOquery is available as part of the BioConductor project.},

abstract = {DNA methylation is the major repression mechanism for human retrotransposons, such as the Alu family. Here, we have determined the methylation levels associated with 5238 loci belonging to 2 Alu subfamilies, AluYa5 and AluYb8, using high-throughput targeted repeat element bisulfite sequencing (HT-TREBS). The results indicate that ∼90{\%} of loci are repressed by high methylation levels. Of the remaining loci, many of the hypomethylated elements are found near gene promoters and show high levels of DNA methylation variation. We have characterized this variation in the context of tumorigenesis and interindividual differences. Comparison of a primary breast tumor and its matched normal tissue revealed early DNA methylation changes in ∼1{\%} of AluYb8 elements in response to tumorigenesis. Simultaneously, AluYa5/Yb8 elements proximal to promoters also showed differences in methylation of up to one order of magnitude, even between normal individuals. Overall, the current study demonstrates that early loss of methylation occurs during tumorigenesis in a subset of young Alu elements, suggesting their potential clinical relevance. However, approaches such as deep-bisulfite-sequencing of individual loci using HT-TREBS are required to distinguish clinically relevant loci from the background observed for AluYa5/Yb8 elements in general with regard to high levels of interindividual variation in DNA methylation.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic ribosomal RNA (rRNA) contains numerous modified nucleotides: about 115 methyl groups and some 95 pseudouridines in vertebrates; about 65 methyl groups and some 45 pseudouridines in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. All but about ten of the methyl groups are ribose methylations. The remaining ten are on heterocyclic bases. The ribose methylations occur very rapidly upon the primary rRNA transcript in the nucleolus, probably on nascent chains, and they appear to play an important role in ribosome maturation, at least in vertebrates. All of the methyl groups occur in the conserved core of rRNA. However, there is no consensus feature of sequence or secondary structure for the methylation sites; thus the nature of the signal(s) for site-specific methylations had until recently remained a mystery. The situation changed dramatically with the discovery that many of the ribose methylation sites are in regions that are precisely complementary to small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) species. Experimental evidence indicates that structural motifs within the snoRNA species do indeed pinpoint the precise nucleotides to be methylated by the putative 2'-O-methyl transferase(s). Regarding base methylations, the gene DIM1, responsible for modification of the conserved dimethyladenosines near the 3' end of 18S rRNA, has been shown to be essential for viability in S. cerevisiae and is suggested to play a role in the nucleocytoplasmic transport of the small ribosomal subunit. Recently nearly all of the pseudouridines have also been mapped in the rRNA of several eukaryotic species. As is the case for ribose methylations, most pseudouridine modifications occur rapidly upon precursor rRNA, within core sequences, and in a variety of local primary and secondary structure environments. In contrast to ribose methylation, no potentially unifying process has yet been identified for the enzymic recognition of the many pseudouridine modification sites. However, the new data afford the basis for a search for any potential involvement of snoRNAs in the recognition process.},

abstract = {The mechanism of cellular aging has been suggested to play an important role in organismic aging, but the molecular linkage between them is not still understood. The recent progress in the studies of telomere and telomerase demonstrates their substantial roles in the mechanism of cellular aging. On the other hand, these studies also raise controversial issues about the generality of the telomere hypothesis. The heterochronic, polymorphic, and probabilistic features of cellular aging should be reconsidered critically. In this review, we attempt to develop a general scheme for the driving force of cellular aging, based on our molecular and computational studies. Our molecular analyses suggest that global transcriptional repressive structures are essentially involved in cellular aging-associated transcriptional regulation. From our theoretical studies, systematic reorganization of these repressive structures are suggested to be a fundamental driving force of cellular aging. The heterochromatin island hypothesis is proposed to give a rational explanation for the three distinctive features of cellular aging. The importance of a dynamic equilibrium in heterochromatin islands is also discussed for cellular and organismic aging.},

abstract = {Selective autophagy requires the specific segregation of targeted proteins into autophagosomes. The selectivity is mediated by autophagy receptors, such as p62 and NBR1, which can bind to autophagic effector proteins (Atg8 in yeast, MAP1LC3 protein family in mammals) anchored in the membrane of autophagosomes. Recognition of autophagy receptors by autophagy effectors takes place through an LC3 interaction region (LIR). The canonical LIR motif consists of a WXXL sequence, N-terminally preceded by negatively charged residues. The LIR motif of NBR1 presents differences to this classical LIR motif with a tyrosine residue and an isoleucine residue substituting the tryptophan residue and the leucine residue, respectively. We have determined the structure of the GABARAPL-1/NBR1-LIR complex and studied the influence of the different residues belonging to the LIR motif for the interaction with several mammalian autophagy modifiers (LC3B and GABARAPL-1). Our results indicate that the presence of a tryptophan residue in the LIR motif increases the binding affinity. Substitution by other aromatic amino acids or increasing the number of negatively charged residues at the N-terminus of the LIR motif, however, has little effect on the binding affinity due to enthalpy-entropy compensation. This indicates that different LIRs can interact with autophagy modifiers with unique binding properties.},

The methylated residues of both the viral and cellular mRNAs occur in two sequences; Gpm6ApC and (Ap)nm6ApC, where n = 1-4. More than 60{\%} of the m6A residues in SV40 16S and 19S mRNAs occur in Gpm6ApC even though there are twice as many (A)nAC than GAC sequences in these messengers. The m6A containing oligonucleotides of late SV40 MRNAs were localized in the viral messengers. In the 16S mRNA two m6A oligonucleotides were located at the 5' coding region between 0.95--0.0 map units. The third m6A residue was mapped between 0.0--0.14 map units in the translated portion of this mRNA. The overall pattern of internal methylation in the 19S mRNA is similar. However, some differences between 16S and 19S mRNAs were observed in both the content and location of the longer (Ap)n m6AC nucleotides. These results provide the first example of precise localization of internal methylation sequences in mRNA species with defined coding specificity. It implies that a) location of m6A residues is not random but specific to a particular region of the RNA, b) apart from sequence specificity other structural features of the mRNA may influence internal methylation and c) m6A residues are present in coding regions of SV40 mRNAs.},

We show that inverted repeat (IR) boundary elements flanking the fission yeast mating-type heterochromatin domain contain B-box sequences, which prevent heterochromatin from spreading into neighboring euchromatic regions by recruiting transcription factor TFIIIC complex without RNA polymerase III (Pol III). Genome-wide analysis reveals TFIIIC with Pol III at all tRNA genes, many of which cluster at pericentromeric heterochromatin domain boundaries. However, a single tRNA(phe) gene with modest TFIIIC enrichment is insufficient to serve as boundary and requires RNAi-associated element to restrain heterochromatin spreading. Remarkably, we found TFIIIC localization without Pol III at many sites located between divergent promoters. These sites appear to act as chromosome-organizing clamps by tethering distant loci to the nuclear periphery, at which TFIIIC is concentrated into several distinct bodies. Our analyses uncover a general genome organization mechanism involving conserved TFIIIC complex.},

To clarify the role of the C-terminal region, we performed systematic cysteine mutagenesis and constructed a chimeric MotB protein which was replaced with the peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein Pal. Although this chimera could not restore motility to a motB strain, we were able to isolate two motile revertants. One was F172V in the Pal region and the other was P159L in the MotB region. Furthermore, we attempted to map the MotB Cys mutations in the crystal structure of Escherichia coli Pal. We found that the MotB mutations that affected motility nearly overlapped with the predicted PG-binding residues of Pal. Our results indicate that, although the functions of MotB and Pal are very different, the PGB region of Pal is interchangeable with the PGB region of MotB.},

abstract = {Two forms of Mod5p, a tRNA modification enzyme, are found in three intracellular compartments, mitochondria, cytoplasm and nucleus, but are encoded by a single MOD5 gene. The two forms of the enzyme, Mod5p-I and Mod5p-II differ at the N-termini and are produced by initiation of translation at different start codons. Mod5p-I does contain a mitochondrial targeting signal and is distributed between mitochondria and cytoplasm, whereas Mod5p-II is found in the cytosol and nucleus (Boguta, M., et al. 1994, Mol. Cell. Biol. 14, 2298-2306). In the present work mutants which mislocalize the Mod5p-I enzyme were isolated. The screen was based on a correlation between the amount of cytosolic protein and the efficiency of tRNA mediated suppression. Identification of mutants is possible because a red pigment accumulates in the cells unable to suppress an ade2-1 nonsense allele. The maf1 mutant, with an altered intracellular localization of the Mod5p-I protein, was isolated. Immunofluorescence data suggest that the mutation causes mislocalization of the Mod5p-I to the nucleus.},

abstract = {Cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) is a global regulator that modulates pathogen virulence and biofilm formation in bacteria. Although a bioinformatic study revealed that PilZ domain proteins are the long-sought c-di-GMP binding proteins, the mechanism by which c-di-GMP regulates them is uncertain. Pseudomonas putida PP4397 is one such protein that contains YcgR-N and PilZ domains and the apo-PP4397 structure was solved earlier by the Joint Center for Structural Genomics. We determined the crystal structure of holo-PP4397 and found that two intercalated c-di-GMPs fit into the junction of its YcgR-N and PilZ domains. Moreover, c-di-GMP binding induces PP4397 to undergo a dimer-to-monomer transition. Interestingly, another PilZ domain protein, VCA0042, binds to a single molecule of c-di-GMP, and both its apo and holo forms are dimeric. Mutational studies and the additional crystal structure of holo-VCA0042 (L135R) showed that the Arg122 residue of PP4397 is crucial for the recognition of two molecules of c-di-GMP. Thus, PilZ domain proteins exhibit different c-di-GMP binding stoichiometry and quaternary structure, and these differences are expected to play a role in generating diverse forms of c-di-GMP-mediated regulation.},

abstract = {Protein-directed intracellular transport has not been observed in bacteria despite the existence of dynamic protein localization and a complex cytoskeleton. However, protein trafficking has clear potential uses for important cellular processes such as growth, development, chromosome segregation, and motility. Conflicting models have been proposed to explain Myxococcus xanthus motility on solid surfaces, some favoring secretion engines at the rear of cells and others evoking an unknown class of molecular motors distributed along the cell body. Through a combination of fluorescence imaging, force microscopy, and genetic manipulation, we show that membrane-bound cytoplasmic complexes consisting of motor and regulatory proteins are directionally transported down the axis of a cell at constant velocity. This intracellular motion is transmitted to the exterior of the cell and converted to traction forces on the substrate. Thus, this study demonstrates the existence of a conserved class of processive intracellular motors in bacteria and shows how these motors have been adapted to produce cell motility.},

abstract = {The ability to measure human aging from molecular profiles has practical implications in many fields, including disease prevention and treatment, forensics, and extension of life. Although chronological age has been linked to changes in DNA methylation, the methylome has not yet been used to measure and compare human aging rates. Here, we build a quantitative model of aging using measurements at more than 450,000 CpG markers from the whole blood of 656 human individuals, aged 19 to 101. This model measures the rate at which an individual's methylome ages, which we show is impacted by gender and genetic variants. We also show that differences in aging rates help explain epigenetic drift and are reflected in the transcriptome. Moreover, we show how our aging model is upheld in other human tissues and reveals an advanced aging rate in tumor tissue. Our model highlights specific components of the aging process and provides a quantitative readout for studying the role of methylation in age-related disease.},

abstract = {Most mammalian RNA polymerase II initiation events occur at CpG islands, which are rich in CpGs and devoid of DNA methylation. Despite their relevance for gene regulation, it is unknown to what extent the CpG dinucleotide itself actually contributes to promoter activity. To address this question, we determined the transcriptional activity of a large number of chromosomally integrated promoter constructs and monitored binding of transcription factors assumed to play a role in CpG island activity. This revealed that CpG density significantly improves motif-based prediction of transcription factor binding. Our experiments also show that high CpG density alone is insufficient for transcriptional activity, yet results in increased transcriptional output when combined with particular transcription factor motifs. However, this CpG contribution to promoter activity is independent of DNA methyltransferase activity. Together, this refines our understanding of mammalian promoter regulation as it shows that high CpG density within CpG islands directly contributes to an environment permissive for full transcriptional activity.},

@article{Lindgren2019,
abstract = {Background: Areal bone mineral density (aBMD) estimated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is used to estimate peak bone mass, define osteoporosis and predict fracture. However, as aBMD is calculated as bone mineral content (BMC) divided by the scanned area, aBMD displays an inverse relationship with bone size. In a skeleton that is increasing in size, this is a problem, as bone size is an independent factor that determines bone strength. It could therefore be questioned whether peak aBMD is the period with greatest bone strength, a period that in the hip then would occur in ages 16-19. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether there are changes in bone size in men after age 18 that may influence peak bone strength. Another aim was to provide updated normative DXA data. Methods: We scanned left femoral neck by DXA in a cross-sectional study with a population-based selection of 1052 men aged 18-28, and then registered bone mineral content (BMC, gram), aBMD (gram/cm2) and bone area (cm2) in each one-year age group. We performed analyses of variance (ANOVA) to evaluate whether there were differences in these traits between the age groups. We then used Pearson's correlation analyses to test for trends with ageing after peak bone mass was reached. Results: We found the highest absolute femoral neck aBMD at age 19, with statistically significant differences between the one-year age groups in BMC, aBMD, and bone area (all p {\textless} 0.05). From peak bone mass onwards (n = 962), there are negative correlations between age and BMC (r =-0.07; p {\textless} 0.05) and age and aBMD (r =-0.12; p {\textless} 0.001), and positive correlation between age and bone area (r = 0.06; p {\textless} 0.05). Conclusion: As femoral neck bone size in young adult men becomes larger after peak bone mass, it could be questioned whether DXA estimated peak aBMD correlates with peak bone strength. We infer that aBMD must be interpreted with care in individuals with a growing skeleton, since skeletal strength may then increase, in spite of decreasing aBMD. This should be taken into account when performing DXA measurements in these ages.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: CpG methylation variation is involved in human trait formation and disease susceptibility. Analyses within populations have been biased towards CpG-dense regions through the application of targeted arrays. We generate whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data for approximately 30 adipose and blood samples from monozygotic and dizygotic twins for the characterization of non-genetic and genetic effects at single-site resolution.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Purely invariable CpGs display a bimodal distribution with enrichment of unmethylated CpGs and depletion of fully methylated CpGs in promoter and enhancer regions. Population-variable CpGs account for approximately 15-20 {\%} of total CpGs per tissue, are enriched in enhancer-associated regions and depleted in promoters, and single nucleotide polymorphisms at CpGs are a frequent confounder of extreme methylation variation. Differential methylation is primarily non-genetic in origin, with non-shared environment accounting for most of the variance. These non-genetic effects are mainly tissue-specific. Tobacco smoking is associated with differential methylation in blood with no evidence of this exposure impacting cell counts. Opposite to non-genetic effects, genetic effects of CpG methylation are shared across tissues and thus limit inter-tissue epigenetic drift. CpH methylation is rare, and shows similar characteristics of variation patterns as CpGs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the utility of low pass whole-genome bisulfite sequencing in identifying methylome variation beyond promoter regions, and suggests that targeting the population dynamic methylome of tissues requires assessment of understudied intergenic CpGs distal to gene promoters to reveal the full extent of inter-individual variation.},

abstract = {Epigenetic control of gene transcription is critical for normal human development and cellular differentiation. While alterations of epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation have been linked to cancers and many other human diseases, interindividual epigenetic variations in normal tissues due to aging, environmental factors, or innate susceptibility are poorly characterized. The plasticity, tissue-specific nature, and variability of gene expression are related to epigenomic states that vary across individuals. Thus, population-based investigations are needed to further our understanding of the fundamental dynamics of normal individual epigenomes. We analyzed 217 non-pathologic human tissues from 10 anatomic sites at 1,413 autosomal CpG loci associated with 773 genes to investigate tissue-specific differences in DNA methylation and to discern how aging and exposures contribute to normal variation in methylation. Methylation profile classes derived from unsupervised modeling were significantly associated with age (P{\textless}0.0001) and were significant predictors of tissue origin (P{\textless}0.0001). In solid tissues (n = 119) we found striking, highly significant CpG island-dependent correlations between age and methylation; loci in CpG islands gained methylation with age, loci not in CpG islands lost methylation with age (P{\textless}0.001), and this pattern was consistent across tissues and in an analysis of blood-derived DNA. Our data clearly demonstrate age- and exposure-related differences in tissue-specific methylation and significant age-associated methylation patterns which are CpG island context-dependent. This work provides novel insight into the role of aging and the environment in susceptibility to diseases such as cancer and critically informs the field of epigenomics by providing evidence of epigenetic dysregulation by age-related methylation alterations. Collectively we reveal key issues to consider both in the construction of reference and disease-related epigenomes and in the interpretation of potentially pathologically important alterations.},

Although a few of the copies are active, Alu germline activity is the highest of all human retrotransposons and does significantly contribute to genetic disease and population diversity. There are two basic mechanisms by which Alu elements contribute to disease: through insertional mutagenesis and as a large source of repetitive sequences that contribute to nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) that cause genetic deletions and duplications. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {BACKGROUND DNA methylation changes at a discrete set of sites in the human genome are predictive of chronological and biological age. However, it is not known whether these changes are causative or a consequence of an underlying ageing process. It has also not been shown whether this epigenetic clock is unique to humans or conserved in the more experimentally tractable mouse. RESULTS We have generated a comprehensive set of genome-scale base-resolution methylation maps from multiple mouse tissues spanning a wide range of ages. Many CpG sites show significant tissue-independent correlations with age which allowed us to develop a multi-tissue predictor of age in the mouse. Our model, which estimates age based on DNA methylation at 329 unique CpG sites, has a median absolute error of 3.33 weeks and has similar properties to the recently described human epigenetic clock. Using publicly available datasets, we find that the mouse clock is accurate enough to measure effects on biological age, including in the context of interventions. While females and males show no significant differences in predicted DNA methylation age, ovariectomy results in significant age acceleration in females. Furthermore, we identify significant differences in age-acceleration dependent on the lipid content of the diet. CONCLUSIONS Here we identify and characterise an epigenetic predictor of age in mice, the mouse epigenetic clock. This clock will be instrumental for understanding the biology of ageing and will allow modulation of its ticking rate and resetting the clock in vivo to study the impact on biological age.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) databases represent a valuable resource to link disease-associated SNPs to specific candidate genes whose gene expression is significantly modulated by the SNP under investigation. We previously identified signal inhibitory receptor on leukocytes-1 (SIRL-1) as a powerful regulator of human innate immune cell function. While it is constitutively high expressed on neutrophils, on monocytes the SIRL-1 surface expression varies strongly between individuals. The underlying mechanism of regulation, its genetic control as well as potential clinical implications had not been explored yet. METHODS Whole blood eQTL data of a Chinese cohort was used to identify SNPs regulating the expression of VSTM1, the gene encoding SIRL-1. The genotype effect was validated by flow cytometry (cell surface expression), correlated with electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and bisulfite sequencing (C-methylation) and its functional impact studied the inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS). RESULTS We found a significant association of a single CpG-SNP, rs612529T/C, located in the promoter of VSTM1. Through flow cytometry analysis we confirmed that primarily in the monocytes the protein level of SIRL-1 is strongly associated with genotype of this SNP. In monocytes, the T allele of this SNP facilitates binding of the transcription factors YY1 and PU.1, of which the latter has been recently shown to act as docking site for modifiers of DNA methylation. In line with this notion rs612529T associates with a complete demethylation of the VSTM1 promoter correlating with the allele-specific upregulation of SIRL-1 expression. In monocytes, this upregulation strongly impacts the IgA-induced production of ROS by these cells. Through targeted association analysis we found a significant Meta P value of 1.14 × 10-6 for rs612529 for association to atopic dermatitis (AD). CONCLUSION Low expression of SIRL-1 on monocytes is associated with an increased risk for the manifestation of an inflammatory skin disease. It thus underlines the role of both the cell subset and this inhibitory immune receptor in maintaining immune homeostasis in the skin. Notably, the genetic regulation is achieved by a single CpG-SNP, which controls the overall methylation state of the promoter gene segment.},

abstract = {In general, methylation of the promoter regions is inversely correlated with gene expression. The transitional CpG area between the promoter-associated CpG islands and the nearby retroelements is often methylated in a tissue-specific manner. This study analyzed the relationship between gene expression and the methylation of the transitional CpGs in two human stromal cells derived from the bone marrow (BMSC) and adipose tissue (ATSC), both of which have a multilineage differentiation potential. The transitional CpGs of the osteoblast-specific (RUNX2 and BGLAP), adipocyte-specific (PPARgamma2), housekeeping (CDKN2A and MLH1), and mesenchyme-unrelated (RUNX3) genes were examined by methylation-specific PCR. The expression of each gene was measured using reverse-transcription PCR analysis. The RUNX2, BGLAP, and CDKN2A genes in the BMSC, and the PPARgamma2 gene in the ATSC exhibited hypomethylation of the transitional CpGs along with the strong expression. The CpG island of RUNX3 gene not expressed in both BMSC and ATSC was hypermethylated. Transitional hypomethylation of the MLH1 gene was accompanied by the higher expression in the BMSC than in the ATSC. The weakly methylated CpGs of the PPARgamma2 gene in the BMSC became hypomethylated along with the strong expression during the osteoblastic differentiation. There were no notable changes in the transitional methylation and expression of the genes other than PPARgamma2 after the differentiation. Therefore, the transitional methylation and gene expression established in mesenchymal cells tend to be consistently preserved under the induction of differentiation. Weak transitional methylation of the PPARgamma2 gene in the BMSC suggests a methylation-dependent mechanism underlying the adiopogenesis of bone marrow.},

Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are genomic regions showing different degrees of DNA methylation in multiple samples. In this study, we focused our attention on CGIs showing different DNA methylation between two culture replicas of the same cell line.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We used methylation data of 35 cell lines from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) consortium to identify CpG islands that were differentially methylated between replicas of the same cell line and denoted them Inter Replicas Differentially Methylated CpG islands (IRDM-CGIs). We identified a group of IRDM-CGIs that was consistently shared by different cell lines, and denoted it common IRDM-CGIs. X chromosome CGIs were overrepresented among common IRDM-CGIs. Autosomal IRDM-CGIs were preferentially located in gene bodies and intergenic regions had a lower G + C content, a smaller mean length, and a reduced CpG percentage. Functional analysis of the genes associated with autosomal IRDM-CGIs showed that many of them are involved in DNA binding and development.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our results show that several specific functional and structural features characterize common IRDM-CGIs. They may represent a specific subset of CGIs that are more prone to being differentially methylated for their intrinsic characteristics.},

abstract = {DNA methylation is one of the most studied epigenetic marks in the human genome, with the result that the desire to map the human methylome has driven the development of several methods to map DNA methylation on a genomic scale. Our study presents the first comparison of two of these techniques - the targeted approach of the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip{\textregistered} with the immunoprecipitation and sequencing-based method, MeDIP-seq. Both methods were initially validated with respect to bisulfite sequencing as the gold standard and then assessed in terms of coverage, resolution and accuracy. The regions of the methylome that can be assayed by both methods and those that can only be assayed by one method were determined and the discovery of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) by both techniques was examined. Our results show that the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip{\textregistered} and MeDIP-seq show a good positive correlation (Spearman correlation of 0.68) on a genome-wide scale and can both be used successfully to determine differentially methylated loci in RefSeq genes, CpG islands, shores and shelves. MeDIP-seq however, allows a wider interrogation of methylated regions of the human genome, including thousands of non-RefSeq genes and repetitive elements, all of which may be of importance in disease. In our study MeDIP-seq allowed the detection of 15,709 differentially methylated regions, nearly twice as many as the array-based method (8070), which may result in a more comprehensive study of the methylome.},

Now, tRNA research is blooming again, with demonstration of the involvement of tRNAs in various other pathways beyond translation and in adapting translation to environmental cues. These roles are linked to the presence of tRNA sequence variants known as isoacceptors and isodecoders, various tRNA base modifications, the versatility of protein binding partners and tRNA fragmentation events, all of which collectively create an incalculable complexity. This complexity provides a vast repertoire of tRNA species that can serve various functions in cellular homeostasis and in adaptation of cellular functions to changing environments, and it likely arose from the fundamental role of RNAs in early evolution.},

MCM8IP-deficient cells exhibit HR defects, especially in long-tract gene conversion, occurring downstream of RAD51 loading, consistent with a role for MCM8IP in HR-dependent DNA synthesis. Moreover, loss of MCM8IP confers cellular sensitivity to crosslinking agents and PARP inhibition. Importantly, we report that MCM8IP directly associates with MCM8-9, a helicase complex mutated in primary ovarian insufficiency, and RPA1. We additionally show that the interactions of MCM8IP with MCM8-9 and RPA facilitate HR and promote replication fork progression and cellular viability in response to treatment with crosslinking agents. Mechanistically, MCM8IP stimulates the helicase activity of MCM8-9.

abstract = {The mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, linking glycolysis to the tricarboxylic acid cycle and fatty acid (FA) synthesis. Knowledge of the mechanisms that regulate PDC activity is important, because PDC inactivation is crucial for glucose conservation when glucose is scarce, whereas adequate PDC activity is required to allow both ATP and FA production from glucose. The mechanisms that control mammalian PDC activity include its phosphorylation (inactivation) by a family of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs 1-4) and its dephosphorylation (activation, reactivation) by the pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphate phosphatases (PDPs 1 and 2). Isoform-specific differences in kinetic parameters, regulation, and phosphorylation site specificity of the PDKs introduce variations in the regulation of PDC activity in differing endocrine and metabolic states. In this review, we summarize recent significant advances in our knowledge of the mechanisms regulating PDC with emphasis on the PDKs, in particular PDK4, whose expression is linked with sustained changes in tissue lipid handling and which may represent an attractive target for pharmacological interventions aimed at modulating whole body glucose, lipid, and lactate homeostasis in disease states.},

abstract = {Osteoclasts are multinucleated bone resorbing cells which form by fusion of pre-osteoclasts. Here, we investigate how nitric oxide (NO) affects osteoclastogenesis. Time lapse photomicrography, using the fluorescent NO indicator dye, 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate, revealed an intense NO signal in pre-osteoclasts preceding cell fusion. Osteoclastogenesis in RAW264.7 cells increased when exposed to the NO synthase inhibitor, l-NMMA (0.25 $\mu$M), for the initial 48 h. In contrast, pre-osteoclast fusion decreased when RAW264.7 cells were exposed to l-NMMA from 48 to 96 h. Both NO synthase inhibitors, l-NMMA and l-NAME, decreased osteoclast formation during this time period. The inhibitory effect of l-NMMA on osteoclast formation was abolished with increasing concentrations (25-200 ng/ml) of sRANKL suggesting signaling cross talk. NO donors increased osteoclast formation in a dose-dependent manner, with greatest stimulation at 15 $\mu$M NOC-12 (2.3 fold) and 5 $\mu$M NOC-18 (2.4 fold). Measuring nitrite (NO end product) daily from culture media of RAW264.7 cells undergoing osteoclastogenesis revealed that an increase in NO production coincided with the fusion of pre-osteoclasts (day 4). Inhibiting fusion by plating cells on polystyrene dishes pre-coated with poly-(l-lysine) decreased both osteoclast formation and NO production. To address if NO mediates fusion through the actin cytoskeleton, actin free barbed ends were measured. 0.25 $\mu$M l-NMMA decreased, while 15 $\mu$M NOC-12 and 5 $\mu$M NOC-18 increased actin free barbed ends. We hypothesize that while NO initially negatively regulates pre-osteoclast differentiation; it later facilitates the fusion of mononuclear pre-osteoclasts, possibly by up regulating actin remodeling. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

abstract = {It has unambiguously been shown that genetic, environmental, demographic, and technical factors may have substantial effects on gene expression levels. In addition to the measured variable(s) of interest, there will tend to be sources of signal due to factors that are unknown, unmeasured, or too complicated to capture through simple models. We show that failing to incorporate these sources of heterogeneity into an analysis can have widespread and detrimental effects on the study. Not only can this reduce power or induce unwanted dependence across genes, but it can also introduce sources of spurious signal to many genes. This phenomenon is true even for well-designed, randomized studies. We introduce "surrogate variable analysis" (SVA) to overcome the problems caused by heterogeneity in expression studies. SVA can be applied in conjunction with standard analysis techniques to accurately capture the relationship between expression and any modeled variables of interest. We apply SVA to disease class, time course, and genetics of gene expression studies. We show that SVA increases the biological accuracy and reproducibility of analyses in genome-wide expression studies.},

To understand the functional consequences of DNA methylation on phenotypic plasticity, a genome-wide analysis should be embraced. This in turn requires a technique that balances accuracy, genome coverage, resolution and cost, yet is low in DNA input in order to minimize the drain on precious samples. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation-sequencing (MeDIP-seq) fulfils these criteria, combining MeDIP with massively parallel DNA sequencing. Here we report an improved protocol using 100-fold less genomic DNA than that commonly used. We show comparable results for specificity ({\textgreater}97{\%}) and enrichment ({\textgreater}100-fold) over a wide range of DNA concentrations (5,000-50 ng) and demonstrate the utility of the protocol for the generation of methylomes from rare bone marrow cells using 160-300 ng of starting DNA. The protocol described here, i.e., DNA extraction to generation of MeDIP-seq library, can be completed within 3-5 d.},

abstract = {Motivation. Finding relevant scientific literature is one of the essential tasks researchers are facing on a daily basis. Digital libraries and web information retrieval techniques provide rapid access to a vast amount of scientific literature. However, no further automated support is available that would enable fine-grained access to the knowledge 'stored' in these documents. The emerging domain of Semantic Publishing aims at making scientific knowledge accessible to both humans and machines, by adding semantic annotations to content, such as a publication's contributions, methods, or application domains. However, despite the promises of better knowledge access, the manual annotation of existing research literature is prohibitively expensive for wide-spread adoption.We argue that a novel combination of three distinct methods can significantly advance this vision in a fully-automated way: (i) Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Rhetorical Entity (RE) detection; (ii) Named Entity (NE) recognition based on the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud; and (iii) automatic knowledge base construction for both NEs and REs using semantic web ontologies that interconnect entities in documents with the machine-readable LODcloud. Results. We present a complete workflow to transform scientific literature into a semantic knowledge base, based on the W3C standards RDF and RDFS. A text mining pipeline, implemented based on the GATE framework, automatically extracts rhetorical entities of type Claims and Contributions fromfull-text scientific literature. These REs are further enriched with named entities, represented as URIs to the linked open data cloud, by integrating the DBpedia Spotlight tool into our workflow. Text mining results are stored in a knowledge base through a flexible export process that provides for a dynamic mapping of semantic annotations to LOD vocabularies through rules stored in the knowledge base. We created a gold standard corpus from computer science conference proceedings and journal articles, where Claim and Contribution sentences are manually annotated with their respective types using LOD URIs. The performance of the RE detection phase is evaluated against this corpus, where it achieves an average F-measure of 0.73. We further demonstrate a number of semantic queries that show how the generated knowledge base can provide support for numerous use cases in managing scientific literature.},

abstract = {Epigenetic inheritance, the transmission of gene expression states from parent to daughter cells, often involves methylation of DNA. In eukaryotes, cytosine methylation is a frequent component of epigenetic mechanisms. Failure to transmit faithfully a methylated or an unmethylated state of cytosine can lead to altered phenotypes in plants and animals. A central unresolved question in epigenetics concerns the mechanisms by which a locus maintains, or changes, its state of cytosine methylation. We developed "hairpin-bisulfite PCR" to analyze these mechanisms. This method reveals the extent of methylation symmetry between the complementary strands of individual DNA molecules. Using hairpin-bisulfite PCR, we determined the fidelity of methylation transmission in the CpG island of the FMR1 gene in human lymphocytes. For the hypermethylated CpG island of this gene, characteristic of inactive-X alleles, we estimate a maintenance methylation efficiency of approximately 0.96 per site per cell division. For de novo methylation efficiency (E(d)), remarkably different estimates were obtained for the hypermethylated CpG island (E(d) = 0.17), compared with the hypomethylated island on the active-X chromosome (E(d) {\textless} 0.01). These results clarify the mechanisms by which the alternative hypomethylated and hypermethylated states of CpG islands are stably maintained through many cell divisions. We also analyzed a region of human L1 transposable elements. These L1 data provide accurate methylation patterns for the complementary strand of each repeat sequence analyzed. Hairpin-bisulfite PCR will be a powerful tool in studying other processes for which genetic or epigenetic information differs on the two complementary strands of DNA.},

abstract = {Objective: Osteoarthritis (OA) is polygenic with over 90 independent genome-wide association loci so far reported. A key next step is the identification of target genes and the molecular mechanisms through which this genetic risk operates. The majority of OA risk-conferring alleles are predicted to act by modulating gene expression. DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides may be a functional conduit through which this occurs and is detectable by mapping methylation quantitative trait loci, or mQTLs. This approach can therefore provide functional insight into OA risk and will prioritize genes for subsequent investigation. That was our goal, with a focus on the largest set of OA loci yet to be reported. Method: We investigated DNA methylation, genotype and RNA sequencing data derived from the cartilage of patients who had undergone arthroplasty and combined this with in silico analyses of expression quantitative trait loci, epigenomes and chromatin interactions. Results: We investigated 42 OA risk loci and in ten of these we identified 24 CpGs in which methylation correlated with genotype (false discovery rate (FDR) P-values ranging from 0.049 to 1.73x10−25). In silico analyses of these mQTLs prioritised genes and regulatory elements at the majority of the ten loci, with COLGALT2 (encoding a collagen galactosyltransferase), COL11A2 (encoding a polypeptide chain of type XI collagen) and WWP2 (encoding a ubiquitin ligase active during chondrogenesis) emerging as particularly compelling target genes. Conclusion: We have highlighted the pivotal role of DNA methylation as a link between genetic risk and OA and prioritized genes for further investigation.},

When in addition use is made of direct string comparison, an improvement of up to a factor of 8 in alignment speed compared to the fastest conventional aligner (Bowtie) is obtained. This results in a total alignment time in targeted sequencing of around 7 min for aligning approximately 56 million captured reads.

Indeed, several studies have revealed that almost half of human transcripts present uORFs. Very interesting examples have shown that these uORFs can impact gene expression of the downstream main ORF by triggering mRNA decay or by regulating translation. Also, evidence from recent genetic and bioinformatic studies implicates disturbed uORF-mediated translational control in the etiology of many human diseases, including malignancies, metabolic or neurologic disorders, and inherited syndromes. In this review, we will briefly present the mechanisms through which uORFs regulate gene expression and how they can impact on the organism's response to different cell stress conditions. Then, we will emphasize the importance of these structures by illustrating, with specific examples, how disturbed uORF-mediated translational control can be involved in the etiology of human diseases, giving special importance to genotype-phenotype correlations. Identifying and studying more cases of uORF-altering mutations will help us to understand and establish genotype-phenotype associations, leading to advancements in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of many human disorders.},

abstract = {Biosynthesis of an Escherichia coli cell, with organic compounds as sources of energy and carbon, requires approximately 20 to 60 billion high-energy phosphate bonds [Stouthamer, A. H. (1973) Antonie van Leeuwenhoek 39, 545-565]. A substantial fraction of this energy budget is devoted to biosynthesis of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. The fueling reactions of central metabolism provide precursor metabolites for synthesis of the 20 amino acids incorporated into proteins. Thus, synthesis of an amino acid entails a dual cost: energy is lost by diverting chemical intermediates from fueling reactions and additional energy is required to convert precursor metabolites to amino acids. Among amino acids, costs of synthesis vary from 12 to 74 high-energy phosphate bonds per molecule. The energetic advantage to encoding a less costly amino acid in a highly expressed gene can be greater than 0.025{\%} of the total energy budget. Here, we provide evidence that amino acid composition in the proteomes of E. coli and Bacillus subtilis reflects the action of natural selection to enhance metabolic efficiency. We employ synonymous codon usage bias as a measure of translation rates and show increases in the abundance of less energetically costly amino acids in highly expressed proteins.},

abstract = {The contribution of repetitive elements to quantitative human traits is largely unknown. Here we report a genome-wide survey of the contribution of short tandem repeats (STRs), which constitute one of the most polymorphic and abundant repeat classes, to gene expression in humans. Our survey identified 2,060 significant expression STRs (eSTRs). These eSTRs were replicable in orthogonal populations and expression assays. We used variance partitioning to disentangle the contribution of eSTRs from that of linked SNPs and indels and found that eSTRs contribute 10-15{\%} of the cis heritability mediated by all common variants. Further functional genomic analyses showed that eSTRs are enriched in conserved regions, colocalize with regulatory elements and may modulate certain histone modifications. By analyzing known genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals and searching for new associations in 1,685 whole genomes from deeply phenotyped individuals, we found that eSTRs are enriched in various clinically relevant conditions. These results highlight the contribution of STRs to the genetic architecture of quantitative human traits.},

abstract = {Bone is a complex connective tissue characterized by a calcified extracellular matrix. This mineralized matrix is constantly being formed and resorbed throughout life, allowing the bone to adapt to daily mechanical loads and maintain skeletal properties and composition. The imbalance between bone formation and bone resorption leads to changes in bone mass. This is the case of osteoporosis and osteoarthritis, two common skeletal disorders. While osteoporosis is characterized by a decreased bone mass and, consequently, higher susceptibly to fractures, bone mass tends to be higher in patients with osteoarthritis, especially in the subchondral bone region. It is known that these diseases are influenced by heritable factors. However, the DNA polymorphisms identified so far in GWAS explain less than 10{\%} of the genetic risk, suggesting that other factors, and specifically epigenetic mechanisms, are involved in the pathogenesis of these disorders. This review summarizes current knowledge about the influence of epigenetic marks on bone homeostasis, paying special attention to the role of DNA methylation in the onset and progression of osteoporosis and osteoarthritis.},

abstract = {Aging is characterized by a profound remodeling of the epigenetic architecture in terms of DNA methylation patterns. To date the most effective tool to study genome wide DNA methylation changes is Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Infinium 450k). Despite the wealth of tools for Infinium 450k analysis, the identification of the most biologically relevant DNA methylation changes is still challenging. Here we propose an analytical pipeline to select differentially methylated regions (DMRs), tailored on microarray architecture, which is highly effective in highlighting biologically relevant results. The pipeline groups microarray probes on the basis of their localization respect to CpG islands and genic sequences and, depending on probes density, identifies DMRs through a single-probe or a region-centric approach that considers the concomitant variation of multiple adjacent CpG probes. We successfully applied this analytical pipeline on 3 independent Infinium 450k datasets that investigated age-associated changes in blood DNA methylation. We provide a consensus list of genes that systematically vary in DNA methylation levels from 0 to 100 years and that have a potentially relevant role in the aging process.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation pathway is essential for the proteolysis of intracellular proteins and peptides. Deubiquitinating enzymes constitute a complex protein family involved in a multitude of cellular processes. The ubiquitin-specific proteases (UBP) are a group of enzymes whose predicted function is to reverse the ubiquitinating reaction by removing ubiquitin from a large variety of substrates. We have lately reported the characterization of human USP25, a specific-ubiquitin protease gene at 21q11.2, with a specific pattern of expression in murine fetal brains and adult testis. RESULTS Database homology searches at the DNA and protein levels and cDNA library screenings led to the identification of a new UBP member in the human genome, named USP28, at 11q23. This novel gene showed preferential expression in heart and muscle. Moreover, cDNA, expressed sequence tag and RT-PCR analyses provided evidence for alternatively spliced products and tissue-specific isoforms. Concerning function, USP25 overexpression in Down syndrome fetal brains was shown by real-time PCR. CONCLUSIONS On the basis of the genomic and protein sequence as well as the functional data, USP28 and USP25 establish a new subfamily of deubiquitinating enzymes. Both genes have alternatively spliced exons that could generate protein isoforms with distinct tissue-specific activity. The overexpression of USP25 in Down syndrome fetal brains supports the gene-dosage effects suggested for other UBP members related to aneuploidy syndromes.},

abstract = {DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) has a central role in copying the pattern of DNA methylation after replication which is one manifestation of epigenetic inheritance. With oligonculeotide substrates we show that mouse Dnmt1 has a 30- to 40-fold preference for hemimethylated DNA that is almost lost after addition of fully methylated oligonucleotides. Using long hemimethylated DNA substrates that carry defined methylation patterns and bisulfite analysis of the methylation reaction products, we show a 15-fold preference for hemimethylated CG sites. Dnmt1 moves along the DNA in a random walk methylating hemimethylated substrates with high processivity ({\textgreater}50 sites are visited on average which corresponds to linear diffusion over 6000 bp). The frequency of skipping sites is very low ({\textless}0.3{\%}) and there is no detectable flanking sequence preference. CGCTC sites tend to terminate the processive methylation of DNA by Dnmt1. Unmethylated DNA is modified non-processively with a preference for methylation at CCGG sites. We simulate the propagation of methylation patterns using a stochastic model with the specificity of Dnmt1 observed here and conclude that either methylation of several sites is required to propagate the methylation information over several cellular generations or additional epigenetic information must be used.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Recent assays for individual-specific genome-wide DNA methylation profiles have enabled epigenome-wide association studies to identify specific CpG sites associated with a phenotype. Computational prediction of CpG site-specific methylation levels is critical to enable genome-wide analyses, but current approaches tackle average methylation within a locus and are often limited to specific genomic regions. RESULTS We characterize genome-wide DNA methylation patterns, and show that correlation among CpG sites decays rapidly, making predictions solely based on neighboring sites challenging. We built a random forest classifier to predict methylation levels at CpG site resolution using features including neighboring CpG site methylation levels and genomic distance, co-localization with coding regions, CpG islands (CGIs), and regulatory elements from the ENCODE project. Our approach achieves 92{\%} prediction accuracy of genome-wide methylation levels at single-CpG-site precision. The accuracy increases to 98{\%} when restricted to CpG sites within CGIs and is robust across platform and cell-type heterogeneity. Our classifier outperforms other types of classifiers and identifies features that contribute to prediction accuracy: neighboring CpG site methylation, CGIs, co-localized DNase I hypersensitive sites, transcription factor binding sites, and histone modifications were found to be most predictive of methylation levels. CONCLUSIONS Our observations of DNA methylation patterns led us to develop a classifier to predict DNA methylation levels at CpG site resolution with high accuracy. Furthermore, our method identified genomic features that interact with DNA methylation, suggesting mechanisms involved in DNA methylation modification and regulation, and linking diverse epigenetic processes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common condition of vision loss with disease development strongly influenced by environmental and genetic factors. Recently, 34 loci were associated with AMD at genome-wide significance. So far, little is known about a genetic overlap between AMD and other complex diseases or disease-relevant traits. METHODS For each of 60 complex diseases/traits with publicly available genome-wide significant association data, the lead genetic variant per independent locus was extracted and a genetic score was calculated for each disease/trait as the weighted sum of risk alleles. The association with AMD was estimated based on 16,144 AMD cases and 17,832 controls using logistic regression. RESULTS Of the respective disease/trait variance, the 60 genetic scores explained on average 4.8{\%} (0.27-20.69{\%}) and 16 of them were found to be significantly associated with AMD (Q-values {\textless} 0.01, p values from {\textless} 1.0 × 10-16 to 1.9 × 10-3). Notably, an increased risk for AMD was associated with reduced risk for cardiovascular diseases, increased risk for autoimmune diseases, higher HDL and lower LDL levels in serum, lower bone-mineral density as well as an increased risk for skin cancer. By restricting the analysis to 1824 variants initially used to compute the 60 genetic scores, we identified 28 novel AMD risk variants (Q-values {\textless} 0.01, p values from 1.1 × 10-7 to 3.0 × 10-4), known to be involved in cardiovascular disorders, lipid metabolism, autoimmune diseases, anthropomorphic traits, ocular disorders, and neurological diseases. The latter variants represent 20 novel AMD-associated, pleiotropic loci. Genes in the novel loci reinforce previous findings strongly implicating the complement system in AMD pathogenesis. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate a substantial overlap of the genetics of several complex diseases/traits with AMD and provide statistically significant evidence for an additional 20 loci associated with AMD. This highlights the possibility that so far unrelated pathologies may have disease pathways in common.},

abstract = {Evolutionary modification has produced a spectrum of animal defence traits to escape predation, including the ability to autotomize body parts to elude capture. After autotomy, the missing part is either replaced through regeneration (for example, in urodeles, lizards, arthropods and crustaceans) or permanently lost (such as in mammals). Although most autotomy involves the loss of appendages (legs, chelipeds, antennae or tails, for example), skin autotomy can occur in certain taxa of scincid and gekkonid lizards. Here we report the first demonstration of skin autotomy in Mammalia (African spiny mice, Acomys). Mechanical testing showed a propensity for skin to tear under very low tension and the absence of a fracture plane. After skin loss, rapid wound contraction was followed by hair follicle regeneration in dorsal skin wounds. Notably, we found that regenerative capacity in Acomys was extended to ear holes, where the mice exhibited complete regeneration of hair follicles, sebaceous glands, dermis and cartilage. Salamanders capable of limb regeneration form a blastema (a mass of lineage-restricted progenitor cells) after limb loss, and our findings suggest that ear tissue regeneration in Acomys may proceed through the assembly of a similar structure. This study underscores the importance of investigating regenerative phenomena outside of conventional model organisms, and suggests that mammals may retain a higher capacity for regeneration than was previously believed. As re-emergent interest in regenerative medicine seeks to isolate molecular pathways controlling tissue regeneration in mammals, Acomys may prove useful in identifying mechanisms to promote regeneration in lieu of fibrosis and scarring.},

While most pol III-transcribed genes are found scattered throughout the linear chromosome maps or in multiple linear clusters, there is increasing evidence that many of these genes prefer to be spatially clustered, often at or near the nucleolus. This association could create an environment that fosters the coregulation of transcription by pol III with transcription of the large ribosomal RNA repeats by RNA polymerase I (pol I) within the nucleolus. Given the high number of pol III-transcribed genes in all eukaryotic genomes, the spatial organization of these genes is likely to affect a large portion of the other genes in a genome. In this Survey and Summary we analyze the reports regarding the spatial organization of pol III genes and address the potential influence of this organization on transcriptional regulation.},

@article{Raj2020,
abstract = {It has been noted for quite some time that DNA methylation levels decline with age. The significance of this change remained unknown until it became possible to measure methylation status of specific sites on the DNA. It was observed that while the methylation of some sites does indeed decrease with age, that of others increase or remain unchanged. The application of machine learning methods to these quantitative changes in multiple sites, allowed the generation of a highly accurate estimator of age, called the epigenetic clock. The application of this clock on large human epidemiological data sets revealed that discordance between the predicted (epigenetic age) and chronological age is associated with many age-related pathologies, particularly when the former is greater than the latter. The epigenetic clock clearly captures to some degree, biological features that accompany the ageing process. Despite the ever-increasing scope of pathologies that are found to be associated with accelerated epigenetic ageing, the basic principles that underlie the ticking of the clock remain elusive. Here, we describe the known molecular and cellular attributes of the clock and consider their properties, and proffer opinions as to how they may be connected and what might be the underlying mechanism. Emerging from these considerations is the inescapable view that epigenetic ageing begins from very early moments after the embryonic stem cell stage and continues un-interrupted through the entire life-course. This appears to be a consequence of processes that are necessary for the development of the organism from conception and to maintain it thereafter through homeostasis. Hence, while the speed of ageing can, and is affected by external factors, the essence of the ageing process itself is an integral part of, and the consequence of the development of life. Impact statement: The field of epigenetic ageing is relatively new, and the speed of its expansion presents a challenge in keeping abreast with new discoveries and their implications. Several reviews have already addressed the great number of pathologies, health conditions, life-style, and external stressors that are associated with changes to the rate of epigenetic ageing. While these associations highlight and affirm the ability of epigenetic clock to capture biologically meaningful changes associated with age, they do not inform us about the underlying mechanisms. In this very early period since the development of the clock, there have been rather limited experimental research that are aimed at uncovering the mechanism. Hence, the perspective that we proffer is derived from available but nevertheless limited lines of evidence that together provide a seemingly coherent narrative that can be tested. This, we believe would be helpful towards uncovering the workings of the epigenetic clock.},

abstract = {Somatic cells have been reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells by introducing a combination of several transcription factors, such as Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from a patient's somatic cells could be a useful source for drug discovery and cell transplantation therapies. However, most human iPS cells are made by viral vectors, such as retrovirus and lentivirus, which integrate the reprogramming factors into the host genomes and may increase the risk of tumour formation. Several non-integration methods have been reported to overcome the safety concern associated with the generation of iPS cells, such as transient expression of the reprogramming factors using adenovirus vectors or plasmids, and direct delivery of reprogramming proteins. Although these transient expression methods could avoid genomic alteration of iPS cells, they are inefficient. Several studies of gene expression, epigenetic modification and differentiation revealed the insufficient reprogramming of iPS cells, thus suggesting the need for improvement of the reprogramming procedure not only in quantity but also in quality. This report will summarize the current knowledge of iPS generation and discuss future reprogramming methods for medical application.},

abstract = {In this prospective study, 87 children were followed up from birth to 14 months with data on maternal vitamin D status during the pregnancy. Postnatal vitamin D supplementation improved vitamin D status but only partly eliminated the differences in bone variables induced by maternal vitamin D status during the fetal period. Intrauterine nutritional deficits may have permanent consequences despite improved nutritional status postnatally. We evaluated the role of prenatal and postnatal vitamin D status on bone parameters in early infancy. Eighty-seven children were followed from birth to 14 months. Background data were collected with a questionnaire and a 3-day food record. At 14 months bone variables were measured with peripheral computed tomography (pQCT) from the left tibia. Serum 25-OHD and bone turnover markers were determined. Findings were compared with maternal vitamin D status during pregnancy. The children were divided into two groups based on vitamin D status during pregnancy. Despite discrepant S-25-OHD at baseline (median 36.3 vs. 52.5 nmol/l, p {\textless} 0.001), the values at 14 months were similar (63 vs. 66 nmol/l, p = 0.58) in Low D and High D. Serum 25-OHD increased more in Low D (p {\textless} 0.001) despite similar total intake of vitamin D (mean 12.3 mu g/day). In Low D, tibial bone mineral content (BMC) was lower at birth but BMC gain was greater (multivariate analysis of variance [MANOVA]; p = 0.032) resulting in similar BMC at 14 months in the two groups. In High D, tibial total bone cross-sectional area was higher at baseline; the difference persisted at 14 months (MANOVA; p = 0.068). Bone mineral density (BMD) and Delta BMD were similar in the two groups. Postnatal vitamin D supplementation improved vitamin D status but only partly eliminated the differences in bone variables induced by maternal vitamin D status during the fetal period. Further attention should be paid to improving vitamin D status during pregnancy.},

abstract = {Identifying reliable biomarkers of aging is a major goal in geroscience. While the first generation of epigenetic biomarkers of aging were developed using chronological age as a surrogate for biological age, we hypothesized that incorporation of composite clinical measures of phenotypic age that capture differences in lifespan and healthspan may identify novel CpGs and facilitate the development of a more powerful epigenetic biomarker of aging. Using an innovative two-step process, we develop a new epigenetic biomarker of aging, DNAm PhenoAge, that strongly outperforms previous measures in regards to predictions for a variety of aging outcomes, including all-cause mortality, cancers, healthspan, physical functioning, and Alzheimer's disease. While this biomarker was developed using data from whole blood, it correlates strongly with age in every tissue and cell tested. Based on an in-depth transcriptional analysis in sorted cells, we find that increased epigenetic, relative to chronological age, is associated with increased activation of pro-inflammatory and interferon pathways, and decreased activation of transcriptional/translational machinery, DNA damage response, and mitochondrial signatures. Overall, this single epigenetic biomarker of aging is able to capture risks for an array of diverse outcomes across multiple tissues and cells, and provide insight into important pathways in aging.},

abstract = {Epigenetic marks are extensively altered in cancer but may also change in normal tissues with age, which is the primary risk factor for most cancers. We conducted an epigenome-wide study to identify age-related methylation sites and examine their relationship to cancer and other underlying epigenetic marks. We analyzed 1006 blood DNA samples of women aged 35-76 years from the Sister Study and found that 7694 (28{\%}) of the 27 578 CpGs assayed were associated with age (false discovery rate, q {\textless} 0.05). Using independent data sets, we confirmed 749 'highconfidence' age-related CpG (arCpGs) sites in normal blood. Based on The Cancer Genome Atlas data, we show that these age-related changes are largely concordant in a broad variety of normal tissues and that a significantly higher (71-91{\%}, P {\textless} 10-74) than expected proportion of increasingly methylated arCpGs (IM-arCpGs) were overmethylated in a wide variety of tumor types. IM-arCpGs sites occurred almost exclusively at CpG islands and were disproportionately marked with the repressive H3K27me3 histone modification (P {\textless} 1 × 10-50). Genes containing these IM-arCpG sites were highly enriched for developmental and signaling pathways (P {\textless} 10-10). Our findings suggest that as cells acquire methylation at age-related sites, they have a lower threshold for malignant transformation that may explain in part the increase in cancer incidence with age. {\textcopyright} The Author 2013.

abstract = {Divergent morphology of species has largely been ascribed to genetic differences in the tissue-specific expression of proteins, which could be achieved by divergence in cis-regulatory elements or by altering the binding specificity of transcription factors (TFs). The relative importance of the latter has been difficult to assess, as previous systematic analyses of TF binding specificity have been performed using different methods in different species. To address this, we determined the binding specificities of 242 Drosophila TFs, and compared them to human and mouse data. This analysis revealed that TF binding specificities are highly conserved between Drosophila and mammals, and that for orthologous TFs, the similarity extends even to the level of very subtle dinucleotide binding preferences. The few human TFs with divergent specificities function in cell types not found in fruit flies, suggesting that evolution of TF specificities contributes to emergence of novel types of differentiated cells.},

abstract = {Given the tissue-specific nature of epigenetic processes, the assessment of disease-relevant tissue is an important consideration for epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). Little is known about whether easily accessible tissues, such as whole blood, can be used to address questions about interindividual epigenomic variation in inaccessible tissues, such as the brain. We quantified DNA methylation in matched DNA samples isolated from whole blood and 4 brain regions (prefrontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, superior temporal gyrus, and cerebellum) from 122 individuals. We explored co-variation between tissues and the extent to which methylomic variation in blood is predictive of interindividual variation identified in the brain. For the majority of DNA methylation sites, interindividual variation in whole blood is not a strong predictor of interindividual variation in the brain, although the relationship with cortical regions is stronger than with the cerebellum. Variation at a subset of probes is strongly correlated across tissues, even in instances when the actual level of DNA methylation is significantly different between them. A substantial proportion of this co-variation, however, is likely to result from genetic influences. Our data suggest that for the majority of the genome, a blood-based EWAS for disorders where brain is presumed to be the primary tissue of interest will give limited information relating to underlying pathological processes. These results do not, however, discount the utility of using a blood-based EWAS to identify biomarkers of disease phenotypes manifest in the brain. We have generated a searchable database for the interpretation of data from blood-based EWAS analyses (http://epigenetics.essex.ac.uk/ bloodbrain/).},

abstract = {The methylation of cytosine and subsequent oxidation constitutes a fundamental epigenetic modification in mammalian genomes, and its abnormalities are intimately coupled to various pathogenic processes including cancer development. Enzymes of the Ten-eleven translocation (TET) family catalyze the stepwise oxidation of 5-methylcytosine in DNA to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and further oxidation products. These oxidized 5-methylcytosine derivatives represent intermediates in the reversal of cytosine methylation, and also serve as stable epigenetic modifications that exert distinctive regulatory roles. It is becoming increasingly obvious that TET proteins and their catalytic products are key regulators of embryonic development, stem cell functions and lineage specification. Over the past several years, the function of TET proteins as a barrier between normal and malignant states has been extensively investigated. Dysregulation of TET protein expression or function is commonly observed in a wide range of cancers. Notably, TET loss-of-function is causally related to the onset and progression of hematologic malignancy in vivo. In this review, we focus on recent advances in the mechanistic understanding of DNA methylation-demethylation dynamics, and their potential regulatory functions in cellular differentiation and oncogenic transformation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND All living organisms are made of individual and identifiable cells, whose number, together with their size and type, ultimately defines the structure and functions of an organism. While the total cell number of lower organisms is often known, it has not yet been defined in higher organisms. In particular, the reported total cell number of a human being ranges between 10(12) and 10(16) and it is widely mentioned without a proper reference. AIM To study and discuss the theoretical issue of the total number of cells that compose the standard human adult organism. SUBJECTS AND METHODS A systematic calculation of the total cell number of the whole human body and of the single organs was carried out using bibliographical and/or mathematical approaches. RESULTS A current estimation of human total cell number calculated for a variety of organs and cell types is presented. These partial data correspond to a total number of 3.72 × 10(13). CONCLUSIONS Knowing the total cell number of the human body as well as of individual organs is important from a cultural, biological, medical and comparative modelling point of view. The presented cell count could be a starting point for a common effort to complete the total calculation.},

abstract = {Climate change has had a significant impact globally on the timing of ecological events such as reproduction and migration in many species. Here, we examined the phenology of reproductive migrations in 10 amphibian species at a wetland in South Carolina, USA using a 30 year dataset. We show for the first time that two autumn-breeding amphibians are breeding increasingly later in recent years, coincident with an estimated 1.2°C increase in local overnight air temperatures during the September through February pre-breeding and breeding periods. Additionally, two winter-breeding species in the same community are breeding increasingly earlier. Four of the 10 species studied have shifted their reproductive timing an estimated 15.3 to 76.4 days in the past 30 years. This has resulted in rates of phenological change that range from 5.9 to 37.2 days per decade, providing examples of some of the greatest rates of changing phenology in ecological events reported to date. Owing to the opposing direction of the shifts in reproductive timing, our results suggest an alteration in the degree of temporal niche overlap experienced by amphibian larvae in this community. Reproductive timing can drive community dynamics in larval amphibians and our results identify an important pathway by which climate change may affect amphibian communities.},

abstract = {DNA methylation, an important type of epigenetic modification in humans, participates in crucial cellular processes, such as embryonic development, X-inactivation, genomic imprinting and chromosome stability. Several platforms have been developed to study genome-wide DNA methylation. Many investigators in the field have chosen the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation microarray for its ability to reliably assess DNA methylation following sodium bisulfite conversion. Here, we analyzed methylation profiles of 489 adult males and 357 adult females generated by the Infinium HumanMethylation450 microarray. Among the autosomal CpG sites that displayed significant methylation differences between the two sexes, we observed a significant enrichment of cross-reactive probes co-hybridizing to the sex chromosomes with more than 94{\%} sequence identity. This could lead investigators to mistakenly infer the existence of significant autosomal sex-associated methylation. Using sequence identity cutoffs derived from the sex methylation analysis, we concluded that 6{\%} of the array probes can potentially generate spurious signals because of co-hybridization to alternate genomic sequences highly homologous to the intended targets. Additionally, we discovered probes targeting polymorphic CpGs that overlapped SNPs. The methylation levels detected by these probes are simply the reflection of underlying genetic polymorphisms but could be misinterpreted as true signals. The existence of probes that are cross-reactive or of target polymorphic CpGs in the Illumina HumanMethylation microarrays can confound data obtained from such microarrays. Therefore, investigators should exercise caution when significant biological associations are found using these array platforms. A list of all cross-reactive probes and polymorphic CpGs identified by us are annotated in this paper.},

abstract = {Poor intrauterine and childhood growth has been linked with the risk of osteoporosis in later life, a relationship which may in part be mediated through altered epigenetic regulation of genes. We previously identified a region within the promoter of the long non-coding RNA ANRIL encoded by the CDKN2A locus, at which differential DNA methylation at birth showed correlations with offspring adiposity. Given the common lineage of adipocytes and osteoblasts, we investigated the relationship between perinatal CDKN2A methylation and bone mass at ages 4 and 6 years. Using sodium bisulfite pyrosequencing we measured the methylation status of the 9 CpGs within this region in umbilical cord samples from discovery (n = 332) and replication (n = 337) cohorts of children from the Southampton Women's Survey, whose bone mass was assessed by DXA (Hologic Discovery). Inverse associations were found between perinatal CDKN2A methylation and whole body minus head bone area (BA), bone mineral content (BMC) and areal bone-mineral density (BMD). This was confirmed in replication and combined data sets (all p {\textless} 0.01), with each 10{\%} increase in methylation being associated with a decrease in BMC of 4-9 g at age 4 years (p≤0.001). Relationships were similar with 6 year bone mass. Functional investigation of the differentially methylated region in the SaOS-2 osteosarcoma cell line showed that transcription factors bound to the identified CpGs in a methylation specific manner, and that CpG mutagenesis modulated ANRIL expression. In conclusion, perinatal methylation at CDKN2A is associated with childhood bone development, and has significance for cell function. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

However, epigenetic studies have demonstrated violations to this rule that are necessary for mammalian physiology; the most notable parental allele expression phenomenon is genomic imprinting. With the identification of endogenous imprinted genes, genomic imprinting became well-established as an epigenetic mechanism in which the expression pattern of a parental allele influences phenotypic expression. The expanding study of genomic imprinting is revealing a significant impact on brain functions and associated diseases. Here, we review key milestones in the field of imprinting and discuss mechanisms and systems in which imprinted genes exert a significant role. This Review provides a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms that modulate genomic imprinting and the roles this epigenetic process plays across mammalian physiology.},

Extensive evidence has been reported that macroautophagy process declines with increasing age. This impairment, probably due to ad libitum feeding, may cause accumulation of altered structures leading to the age-related decline in cell functions. It has been suggested that caloric restriction (CR) and disruption of insulin-like signals contrast the process of aging by prolonged stimulation of macroautophagy. According to this hypothesis, it is shown that life-long weekly administration of an anti-lipolytic drug decreases glucose and insulin levels, stimulates autophagy and intensifies anti-aging effects of submaximal CR.},

abstract = {One common experimental hurdle that arises when explore patterns of cytosine methylation is the generation of data derived from a single specific tissue, often arduous to isolate from a heterogeneous biospecimen. Here we show a new strategy for exploring environment- or mutation-caused changes in cell type- or tissue-specific methylation landscapes, which requires neither transgenic reporter cell lines nor physical separation. This approach takes advantage of a known distinct methylation signature existing in only one of the tissues within an organ under a particular condition. From the information on such compared published methylomes, one can design a set of PCR primers that specifically amplify bisulfite-converted DNA of two nearby genomic regions of interest, thus allowing for tissue-specific DNA methylation data. To validate the performance of the approach, we designed primers able to amplify a portion of a gene in the context of root biology: the Arabidopsis homeotic gene Glabra-2 (Gl2), expressed only in epidermis during cell differentiation. We found that the extent of methylated cytosines appears remarkably different when root epidermis-specific primers were used vs. non-specific ones under three genetic backgrounds involving mutations in genes also associated with the establishment of cell identity. Although the genetic or environmental perturbations to be studied might modify methylation in the primer-annealing zone, leading to a possible misinterpretation of the data, the strategy presented here can become a useful first round screening tool to detect differences in tissue-specific epigenetic status under new conditions.},

abstract = {Motivation: Genome resequencing and short read mapping are two of the primary tools of genomics and are used for many important applications. The current state-of-the-art in mapping uses the quality values and mapping quality scores to evaluate the reliability of the mapping. These attributes, however, are assigned to individual reads and do not directly measure the problematic repeats across the genome. Here, we present the Genome Mappability Score (GMS) as a novel measure of the complexity of resequencing a genome. The GMS is a weighted probability that any read could be unambiguously mapped to a given position and thus measures the overall composition of the genome itself.$\backslash$nResults: We have developed the Genome Mappability Analyzer to compute the GMS of every position in a genome. It leverages the parallelism of cloud computing to analyze large genomes, and enabled us to identify the 5–14{\%} of the human, mouse, fly and yeast genomes that are difficult to analyze with short reads. We examined the accuracy of the widely used BWA/SAMtools polymorphism discovery pipeline in the context of the GMS, and found discovery errors are dominated by false negatives, especially in regions with poor GMS. These errors are fundamental to the mapping process and cannot be overcome by increasing coverage. As such, the GMS should be considered in every resequencing project to pinpoint the ‘dark matter' of the genome, including of known clinically relevant variations in these regions.$\backslash$nAvailability: The source code and profiles of several model organisms are available at http://gma-bio.sourceforge.net$\backslash$nContact: hlee@cshl.edu$\backslash$nSupplementary Information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {Background: Maternal vitamin D status has been associated with bone mass of offspring in many, but not all, observational studies. However, maternal vitamin D repletion during pregnancy has not yet been proven to improve offspring bone mass in a randomised controlled trial. We aimed to assess whether neonates born to mothers supplemented with vitamin D during pregnancy have greater whole-body bone mineral content (BMC) at birth than those of mothers who had not received supplementation. Methods: The Maternal Vitamin D Osteoporosis Study (MAVIDOS) was a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial that recruited pregnant women from three study sites in the UK (Southampton, Oxford, and Sheffield). Eligible participants were older than 18 years, with a singleton pregnancy, gestation of less than 17 weeks, and a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentration of 25-100 nmol/L at 10-17 weeks' gestation. P'articipants were randomly assigned (1:1), in randomly permuted blocks of ten, to either cholecalciferol 1000 IU/day or matched placebo, taken orally, from 14 weeks' gestation (or as soon as possible before 17 weeks' gestation if recruited later) until delivery. Participants and the research team were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was neonatal whole-body BMC, assessed within 2 weeks of birth by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), analysed in all randomly assigned neonates who had a usable DXA scan. Safety outcomes were assessed in all randomly assigned participants. This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial registry, ISRCTN 82927713, and the European Clinical Trials Database, EudraCT 2007-001716-23. Findings: Between Oct 10, 2008, and Feb 11, 2014, we randomly assigned 569 pregnant women to placebo and 565 to cholecalciferol 1000 IU/day. 370 (65{\%}) neonates in the placebo group and 367 (65{\%}) neonates in the cholecalciferol group had a usable DXA scan and were analysed for the primary endpoint. Neonatal whole-body BMC of infants born to mothers assigned to cholecalciferol 1000 IU/day did not significantly differ from that of infants born to mothers assigned to placebo (61{\textperiodcentered}6 g [95{\%} CI 60{\textperiodcentered}3-62{\textperiodcentered}8] vs 60{\textperiodcentered}5 g [59{\textperiodcentered}3-61{\textperiodcentered}7], respectively; p=0{\textperiodcentered}21). We noted no significant differences in safety outcomes, apart from a greater proportion of women in the placebo group with severe post-partum haemorrhage than those in the cholecalciferol group (96 [17{\%}] of 569 mothers in the placebo group vs 65 [12{\%}] of 565 mothers in the cholecalciferol group; p=0{\textperiodcentered}01). No adverse events were deemed to be treatment related. Interpretation: Supplementation of women with cholecalciferol 1000 IU/day during pregnancy did not lead to increased offspring whole-body BMC compared with placebo, but did show that 1000 IU of cholecalciferol daily is sufficient to ensure that most pregnant women are vitamin D replete, and it is safe. These findings support current approaches to vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy. Results of the ongoing MAVIDOS childhood follow-up study are awaited.

abstract = {In mammals, the canonical somatic DNA methylation landscape is established upon specification of the embryo proper and subsequently disrupted within many cancer types 1–4 . However, the underlying mechanisms that direct this genome-scale transformation remain elusive, with no clear model for its systematic acquisition or potential developmental utility 5,6 . Here, we analysed global remethylation from the mouse preimplantation embryo into the early epiblast and extraembryonic ectoderm. We show that these two states acquire highly divergent genomic distributions with substantial disruption of bimodal, CpG density-dependent methylation in the placental progenitor 7,8 . The extraembryonic epigenome includes specific de novo methylation at hundreds of embryonically protected CpG island promoters, particularly those that are associated with key developmental regulators and are orthologously methylated across most human cancer types 9 . Our data suggest that the evolutionary innovation of extraembryonic tissues may have required co-option of DNA methylation-based suppression as an alternative to regulation by Polycomb-group proteins, which coordinate embryonic germ-layer formation in response to extraembryonic cues 10 . Moreover, we establish that this decision is made deterministically, downstream of promiscuously used—and frequently oncogenic—signalling pathways, via a novel combination of epigenetic cofactors. Methylation of developmental gene promoters during tumorigenesis may therefore reflect the misappropriation of an innate trajectory and the spontaneous reacquisition of a latent, developmentally encoded epigenetic landscape. To compare how epigenetic landscapes evolve during early mam-malian development, we generated whole-genome bisulfite sequenc-ing (WGBS) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets from mouse precompacted 8-cell stage embryos, inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm from embryonic day (E)3.5 blastocysts, as well as epiblast and extraembryonic ectoderm (ExE) from E6.5 concep-tuses, the latest stage at which these progenitors remain largely homogeneous and undifferentiated (Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig.},

abstract = {How rod-shaped bacteria form and maintain their shape is an important question in bacterial cell biology. Results from fluorescent light microscopy have led many to believe that the actin homolog MreB and a number of other proteins form long helical filaments along the inner membrane of the cell. Here we show using electron cryotomography of six different rod-shaped bacterial species, at macromolecular resolution, that no long ({\textgreater} 80 nm) helical filaments exist near or along either surface of the inner membrane. We also use correlated cryo-fluorescent light microscopy (cryo-fLM) and electron cryo-tomography (ECT) to identify cytoplasmic bundles of MreB, showing that MreB filaments are detectable by ECT. In light of these results, the structure and function of MreB must be reconsidered: instead of acting as a large, rigid scaffold that localizes cell-wall synthetic machinery, moving MreB complexes may apply tension to growing peptidoglycan strands to ensure their orderly, linear insertion.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND One of the hallmarks of cancer is the disruption of gene expression patterns. Many molecular lesions contribute to this phenotype, and the importance of aberrant DNA methylation profiles is increasingly recognized. Much of the research effort in this area has examined proximal promoter regions and epigenetic alterations at other loci are not well characterized. RESULTS Using whole genome bisulfite sequencing to examine uncharted regions of the epigenome, we identify a type of far-reaching DNA methylation alteration in cancer cells of the distal regulatory sequences described as super-enhancers. Human tumors undergo a shift in super-enhancer DNA methylation profiles that is associated with the transcriptional silencing or the overactivation of the corresponding target genes. Intriguingly, we observe locally active fractions of super-enhancers detectable through hypomethylated regions that suggest spatial variability within the large enhancer clusters. Functionally, the DNA methylomes obtained suggest that transcription factors contribute to this local activity of super-enhancers and that trans-acting factors modulate DNA methylation profiles with impact on transforming processes during carcinogenesis. CONCLUSIONS We develop an extensive catalogue of human DNA methylomes at base resolution to better understand the regulatory functions of DNA methylation beyond those of proximal promoter gene regions. CpG methylation status in normal cells points to locally active regulatory sites at super-enhancers, which are targeted by specific aberrant DNA methylation events in cancer, with putative effects on the expression of downstream genes.},

abstract = {Human promoters divide into 2 classes, the low CpG (LCG) and the high CpG (HCG), based on their CpG dinucleotide content. The LCG class of promoters is hypermethylated and is associated with tissue-specific genes, whereas the HCG class is hypomethylated and associated with broadly expressed genes. By analyzing several chordate genomes separated for hundreds of millions of years, here we show that the divide between low CpG and high CpG promoters is conserved in several distantly related vertebrate taxa (including human, chicken, frog, lizard, and fish) but not in close invertebrate outgroups (sea squirts). Furthermore, LCG and HCG promoters are distinctively associated with tissue-specific and broadly expressed genes in these distantly related vertebrate taxa. Our results indicate that the function of DNA methylation on gene expression is conserved across these vertebrate taxa and suggest that the 2 classes of promoters have evolved early in vertebrate evolution, as a consequence of the advent of global DNA methylation. {\textcopyright} The Author 2008.

Here we present an epigenome-wide association study across 406,365 CpGs in 52 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T1D in three immune effector cell types. We observe a substantial enrichment of differentially variable CpG positions (DVPs) in T1D twins when compared with their healthy co-twins and when compared with healthy, unrelated individuals. These T1D-associated DVPs are found to be temporally stable and enriched at gene regulatory elements. Integration with cell type-specific gene regulatory circuits highlight pathways involved in immune cell metabolism and the cell cycle, including mTOR signalling. Evidence from cord blood of newborns who progress to overt T1D suggests that the DVPs likely emerge after birth. Our findings, based on 772 methylomes, implicate epigenetic changes that could contribute to disease pathogenesis in T1D.},

abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a smoking-related disease characterized by genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. Although association studies have identified multiple genomic regions with replicated associations to COPD, genetic variation only partially explains the susceptibility to lung disease, and suggests the relevance of epigenetic investigations. We performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling in homogenized lung tissue samples from 46 control subjects with normal lung function and 114 subjects with COPD, all former smokers. The differentially methylated loci were integrated with previous genome-wide association study results. The top 535 differentially methylated sites, filtered for a minimum mean methylation difference of 5{\%} between cases and controls, were enriched for CpG shelves and shores. Pathway analysis revealed enrichment for transcription factors. The top differentially methylated sites from the intersection with previous GWAS were in CHRM1, GLT1D1, and C10orf11; sorted by GWAS P-value, the top sites included FRMD4A, THSD4, and C10orf11. Epigenetic association studies complement genetic association studies to identify genes potentially involved in COPD pathogenesis. Enrichment for genes implicated in asthma and lung function and for transcription factors suggests the potential pathogenic relevance of genes identified through differential methylation and the intersection with a broader range of GWAS associations.},

We investigate power of EWAS to detect differential methylation using case-control and disease-discordant monozygotic (MZ) twin designs with genome-wide DNA methylation arrays. Methods and Results: We performed simulations to estimate power under the casecontrol and discordant MZ twin EWAS study designs, under a range of epigenetic risk effect sizes and conditions. For example, to detect a 10{\%} mean methylation difference between affected and unaffected subjects at a genome-wide significance threshold of P=1×10-6, 98MZ twin pairs were required to reach 80{\%} EWAS power, and 112 cases and 112 controls pairs were needed in the case-control design. We also estimated the minimum sample size required to reach 80{\%} EWAS power under both study designs. Our analyses highlighted several factors that significantly influenced EWAS power, including sample size, epigenetic risk effect size, the variance of DNA methylation at the locus of interest and the correlation in DNA methylation patterns within the twin sample. Conclusions: We provide power estimates for array-based DNA methylation EWAS under case-control and disease-discordant MZ twin designs, and explore multiple factors that impact on EWAS power. Our results can help guide EWAS experimental design and interpretation for future epigenetic studies.},

This is consistent with numerous findings about differentiation-associated changes in DNA methylation at promoters, enhancers, gene bodies, and sites that control higher-order chromatin structure. Abnormal increases or decreases in DNA methylation contribute to or are markers for cancer formation and tumour progression. Aberrant DNA methylation is also associated with neurological diseases, immunological diseases, atherosclerosis, and osteoporosis. In this review, I discuss DNA hypermethylation in disease and its interrelationships with normal development as well as proposed mechanisms for the origin of and pathogenic consequences of disease-associated hypermethylation. Disease-linked DNA hypermethylation can help drive oncogenesis partly by its effects on cancer stem cells and by the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP); atherosclerosis by disease-related cell transdifferentiation; autoimmune and neurological diseases through abnormal perturbations of cell memory; and diverse age-associated diseases by age-related accumulation of epigenetic alterations.},

abstract = {In addition to their roles in desensitization and signaling of seven-membrane-spanning receptors, beta-arrestins have been more recently implicated in regulating non-seven-membrane-spanning receptor pathways. By using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified the inhibitor of NF-kappaB, IkappaBalpha, as a binding partner of beta-arrestin 1. Both beta-arrestin 1 and 2 interact with IkappaBalpha in transfected cells as assessed by immunoprecipitation experiments. Additionally, upstream kinases known to regulate the function of IkappaBalpha, such as IkappaB kinase alpha and beta and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase, were also shown to interact with beta-arrestin. Overexpression of either beta-arrestin 1 or beta-arrestin 2 led to marked inhibition of NF-kappaB activity, as measured by reporter gene activity. Inhibition of NF-kappaB activity was independent of the type of stimulus used for NF-kappaB activation. Conversely, suppression of beta-arrestin 1, but not beta-arrestin 2, expression by using RNA interference led to a 3-fold increase in tumor necrosis factor-stimulated NF-kappaB activity as measured by NF-kappaB mobility-shift analysis. These data uncover a role of beta-arrestins in the regulation of NF-kappaB-mediated gene regulation.},

abstract = {Telomerase defers the onset of telomere damage-induced signaling and cellular senescence by adding DNA onto chromosome ends. The ability of telomerase to elongate single-stranded telomeric DNA depends on the reverse transcriptase domain of TERT, and also relies on protein:DNA contacts outside the active site. We purified the N-terminus of human TERT (hTEN) from Escherichia coli, and found that it binds DNA with a preference for telomeric sequence of a certain length and register. hTEN interacted with the C-terminus of hTERT in trans to reconstitute enzymatic activity in vitro. Mutational analysis of hTEN revealed that amino acids Y18 and Q169 were required for telomerase activity in vitro, but not for the interaction with telomere DNA or the C-terminus. These mutants did not reconstitute telomerase activity in cells, maintain telomere length, or extend cellular lifespan. In addition, we found that T116/T117/S118, while dispensable in vitro, were required for cellular immortalization. Thus, the interactions of hTEN with telomere DNA and the C-terminus of hTERT are functionally separable from the role of hTEN in telomere elongation activity in vitro and in vivo, suggesting other roles for the protein and nucleic acid interactions of hTEN within, and possibly outside, the telomerase catalytic core.},

Analysis of 6 annotation categories, revealed evolutionary conserved regions to be the predominant sites for differential DNA methylation and a core region surrounding the transcriptional start site as informative surrogate for promoter methylation. We find 17{\%} of the 873 analyzed genes differentially methylated in their 5′-untranslated regions (5′-UTR) and about one third of the differentially methylated 5′-UTRs to be inversely correlated with transcription.

abstract = {An extensive repertoire of modifications is known to underlie the versatile coding, structural and catalytic functions of RNA, but it remains largely uncharted territory. Although biochemical studies indicate that N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most prevalent internal modification in messenger RNA, an in-depth study of its distribution and functions has been impeded by a lack of robust analytical methods. Here we present the human and mouse m(6)A modification landscape in a transcriptome-wide manner, using a novel approach, m(6)A-seq, based on antibody-mediated capture and massively parallel sequencing. We identify over 12,000 m(6)A sites characterized by a typical consensus in the transcripts of more than 7,000 human genes. Sites preferentially appear in two distinct landmarks--around stop codons and within long internal exons--and are highly conserved between human and mouse. Although most sites are well preserved across normal and cancerous tissues and in response to various stimuli, a subset of stimulus-dependent, dynamically modulated sites is identified. Silencing the m(6)A methyltransferase significantly affects gene expression and alternative splicing patterns, resulting in modulation of the p53 (also known as TP53) signalling pathway and apoptosis. Our findings therefore suggest that RNA decoration by m(6)A has a fundamental role in regulation of gene expression.},

abstract = {Along latency period between an environmental trigger and the onset of subsequent disease is widely recognized in the etiology of certain cancers, yet this phenomenon is not generally considered in the etiology of other conditions such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, or osteoporosis. However, many lines of evidence, including epidemiologic data and data from extensive clinical and experimental studies, indicate that early life events play a powerful role in influencing later susceptibility to certain chronic diseases. An increased understanding of developmental plasticity (defined as the ability of an organism to develop in various ways, depending on the particular environment or setting) provides a conceptual basis for these observations. Developmental plasticity requires stable modulation of gene expression, and this appears to be mediated, at least in part, by epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation and histone modification. Thus, both the genome and the epigenome interactively influence the mature phenotype and determine sensitivity to later environmental factors and the subsequent risk of disease. In this review, we synthesize evidence from several disciplines to support the contention that environmental factors acting during development should be accorded greater weight in models of disease causation.},

abstract = {Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are essential for protein synthesis. In eukaryotes, tRNA biosynthesis employs a specialized RNA polymerase that generates initial transcripts that must be subsequently altered via a multitude of post-transcriptional steps before the tRNAs beome mature molecules that function in protein synthesis. Genetic, genomic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches possible in the powerful Saccharomyces cerevisiae system have led to exciting advances in our understandings of tRNA post-transcriptional processing as well as to novel insights into tRNA turnover and tRNA subcellular dynamics. tRNA processing steps include removal of transcribed leader and trailer sequences, addition of CCA to the 39 mature sequence and, for tRNAHis, addition of a 59 G. About 20{\%} of yeast tRNAs are encoded by intron-containing genes. The three-step splicing process to remove the introns surprisingly occurs in the cytoplasm in yeast and each of the splicing enzymes appears to moonlight in functions in addition to tRNA splicing. There are 25 different nucleoside modifications that are added post-transcriptionally, creating tRNAs in which {\~{}} 15{\%} of the residues are nucleosides other than A, G, U, or C. These modified nucleosides serve numerous important functions including tRNA discrimination, translation fidelity, and tRNA quality control. Mature tRNAs are very stable, but nevertheless yeast cells possess multiple pathways to degrade inappropriately processed or folded tRNAs. Mature tRNAs are also dynamic in cells, moving from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and back again to the cytoplasm; the mechanism and function of this retrograde process is poorly understood. Here, the state of knowledge for tRNA post-transcriptional processing, turnover, and subcellular dynamics is addressed, highlighting the questions that remain. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the Genetics Society of America.},

abstract = {This study examines the genetic expression of the S-adenosyl-L-methionine binding subunit of the mRNA (N6-adenosine)methyltransferase (MT-A70) in cultured cells under conditions known to affect transmethylation reactions. Methionine dependence, disrupted methionine metabolism, and increased transmethylation reactions are all phenotypes characteristic of cancer cells. The results show that both methionine depletion and inhibition of S-adenosyl-L-methionine formation can induce up to a four-fold increase in transcription of this S-adenosyl-L-methionine binding subunit. The two splice-variant mRNAs produced from the MT-A70 gene are transcribed at different rates depending on the level of S-adenosyl-L-methionine inhibition. This result may reflect differing Km values toward the substrate for the different enzyme isoforms. 3-Deazaadenosine, an inhibitor known to block certain mRNA transmethylations, was shown to have no effect on MT-A70 gene expression. This result indicates that the control of MT-A70 gene expression is directly related to methionine availability and the subsequent synthesis of S-adenosyl-L-methionine.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a catabolic process essential for cell homeostasis, at the core of which is the formation of double-membrane organelles called autophagosomes. Atg9 is the only known transmembrane protein required for autophagy and is proposed to deliver membrane to the preautophagosome structures and autophagosomes. We show here that mammalian Atg9 (mAtg9) is required for the formation of DFCP1-positive autophagosome precursors called phagophores. mAtg9 is recruited to phagophores independent of early autophagy proteins, such as ULK1 and WIPI2, but does not become a stable component of the autophagosome membrane. In fact, mAtg9-positive structures interact dynamically with phagophores and autophagosomes without being incorporated into them. The membrane compartment enriched in mAtg9 displays a unique sedimentation profile, which is unaltered upon starvation-induced autophagy. Correlative light electron microscopy reveals that mAtg9 is present on tubular-vesicular membranes emanating from vacuolar structures. We show that mAtg9 resides in a unique endosomal-like compartment and on endosomes, including recycling endosomes, where it interacts with the transferrin receptor. We propose that mAtg9 trafficking through multiple organelles, including recycling endosomes, is essential for the initiation and progression of autophagy; however, rather than acting as a structural component of the autophagosome, it is required for the expansion of the autophagosome precursor.},

Using these and other available data, we discovered and analyzed thousands of neuronal human and mouse circRNAs. circRNAs were extraordinarily enriched in the mammalian brain, well conserved in sequence, often expressed as circRNAs in both human and mouse, and sometimes even detected in Drosophila brains. circRNAs were overall upregulated during neuronal differentiation, highly enriched in synapses, and often differentially expressed compared to their mRNA isoforms. circRNA expression correlated negatively with expression of the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1. Knockdown of ADAR1 induced elevated circRNA expression. Together, we provide a circRNA brain expression atlas and evidence for important circRNA functions and values as biomarkers.},

abstract = {In Escherichia coli, the transcription factor sigma s, encoded by rpoS, controls the expression of a large number of genes involved in cellular responses to a diverse number of stresses, including starvation, osmotic stress, acid shock, cold shock, heat shock, oxidative DNA damage, and transition to stationary phase. A list of over 50 genes under the control of rpoS has been compiled. The transcription factor sigma s acts predominantly as a positive effector, but it does have a negative effect on some genes. The synthesis and accumulation of sigma s are controlled by mechanisms affecting transcription, translation, proteolysis, and the formation of the holoenzyme complex. Transcriptional control of rpoS involves guanosine 3',5'-bispyrophosphate (ppGpp) and polyphosphate as positive regulators and the cAMP receptor protein-cAMP complex (CRP-cAMP) as a negative regulator. Translation of rpoS mRNA is controlled by a cascade of interacting factors, including Hfq, H-NS, dsrA RNA, LeuO, and oxyS RNA that seem to modulate the stability of a region of secondary structure in the ribosome-binding region of the gene's mRNA. The transcription factor sigma s is sensitive to proteolysis by ClpPX in a reaction that is promoted by RssB and inhibited by the chaperone DnaK. Despite the demonstrated involvement of so many factors, arguments have been presented suggesting that sensitivity to proteolysis may be the single most important modulator of sigma s levels. The activity of sigma s may also be modulated by trehalose and glutamate, which activate holoenzyme formation and promote holoenzyme binding to certain promoters.},

Results: We have developed QuickNGS, a new workflow system for laboratories with the need to analyze data from multiple NGS projects at a time. QuickNGS takes advantage of parallel computing resources, a comprehensive back-end database, and a careful selection of previously published algorithmic approaches to build fully automated data analysis workflows. We demonstrate the efficiency of our new software by a comprehensive analysis of 10 RNA-Seq samples which we can finish in only a few minutes of hands-on time. The approach we have taken is suitable to process even much larger numbers of samples and multiple projects at a time. Conclusion: Our approach considerably reduces the barriers that still limit the usability of the powerful NGS technology and finally decreases the time to be spent before proceeding to further downstream analysis and interpretation of the data.},

abstract = {Selective autophagy requires the specific segregation of targeted proteins into autophagosomes. The selectivity is mediated by autophagy receptors, such as p62 and NBR1, which can bind to autophagic effector proteins (Atg8 in yeast, MAP1LC3 protein family in mammals) anchored in the membrane of autophagosomes. Recognition of autophagy receptors by autophagy effectors takes place through an LC3 interaction region (LIR). The canonical LIR motif consists of a WXXL sequence, N-terminally preceded by negatively charged residues. The LIR motif of NBR1 presents differences to this classical LIR motif with a tyrosine residue and an isoleucine residue substituting the tryptophan residue and the leucine residue, respectively. We have determined the structure of the GABARAPL-1/NBR1-LIR complex and studied the influence of the different residues belonging to the LIR motif for the interaction with several mammalian autophagy modifiers (LC3B and GABARAPL-1). Our results indicate that the presence of a tryptophan residue in the LIR motif increases the binding affinity. Substitution by other aromatic amino acids or increasing the number of negatively charged residues at the N-terminus of the LIR motif, however, has little effect on the binding affinity due to enthalpy-entropy compensation. This indicates that different LIRs can interact with autophagy modifiers with unique binding properties.},

We found that SUZ12 is distributed across large portions of over two hundred genes encoding key developmental regulators. These genes are occupied by nucleosomes trimethylated at histone H3K27, are transcriptionally repressed, and contain some of the most highly conserved noncoding elements in the genome. We found that PRC2 target genes are preferentially activated during ES cell differentiation and that the ES cell regulators OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG cooccupy a significant subset of these genes.

abstract = {By comparing the effects of strong and weak promoters that drive sense chalcone synthase (Chs) transgenes in large populations of independently transformed plants, we show here that a strong transgene promoter is required for high-frequency cosuppression of Chs genes and for production of the full range of cosuppression phenotypes. In addition, sense Chs transgenes driven by a cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter possessing a single copy of the upstream activator region (UAR) were found to produce a significantly lower degree of cosuppression than they did when the transgene promoter possessed two or four copies of the UAR. It has been shown elsewhere that 35S promoter strength increases with increasing UAR copy number. Frameshift mutations producing early nonsense codons in the Chs transgene were found to reduce the frequency and the degree of cosuppression. These results suggest that promoter strength and transcript stability determine the degree of cosuppression, supporting the hypothesis that sense cosuppression is a response to the accumulation of transcripts at high concentrations. This conclusion was shown to apply to single-copy transgenes but not necessarily to inversely repeated transgenes. The results presented here also have significance for efficient engineering of cosuppression phenotypes for use in research and agriculture.},

For technical reasons, the reported structure had been determined using a gapped DNA molecule lacking two phosphates important for CAP-DNA interaction. In this work, we report the crystallographic structure of the CAP-DNA complex at 2.5 A resolution using a DNA molecule having all phosphates important for CAP-DNA interaction. The present resolution permits unambiguous identification of amino acid-base and amino acid-phosphate hydrogen bonded contacts in the CAP-DNA complex. In addition, the present resolution permits accurate definition of the kinked DNA conformation in the CAP-DNA complex.},

abstract = {The severe Duchenne and milder Becker muscular dystrophy are both caused by mutations in the DMD gene. This gene codes for dystrophin, a protein important for maintaining the stability of muscle-fiber membranes. In 1988, Monaco and colleagues postulated an explanation for the phenotypic difference between Duchenne and Becker patients in the reading-frame rule: In Duchenne patients, mutations induce a shift in the reading frame leading to prematurely truncated, dysfunctional dystrophins. In Becker patients, in-frame mutations allow the synthesis of internally deleted, but largely functional dystrophins. Currently, over 4700 mutations have been reported in the Leiden DMD mutation database, of which 91{\%} are in agreement with this rule. In this study we provide an update of the mutational variability in the DMD gene, particularly focusing on genotype-phenotype correlations and mutations that appear to be exceptions to the reading-frame rule.},

abstract = {Acinetobacter baumannii contains RND-family efflux systems AdeABC and AdeIJK, which pump out a wide range of antimicrobial compounds, as judged from the MIC changes occurring upon deletion of the responsible genes. However, these studies may miss changes because of the high backgrounds generated by the remaining pumps and by $\beta$-lactamases, and it is unclear how the activities of these pumps compare quantitatively with those of the well-studied AcrAB-TolC system of Escherichia coli. We expressed adeABC and adeIJK of A. baumannii, as well as E. coli acrAB, in an E. coli host from which acrAB was deleted. The A. baumannii pumps were functional in E. coli, and the MIC changes that were observed largely confirmed the substrate range already reported, with important differences. Thus, the AdeABC system pumped out all $\beta$-lactams, an activity that was often missed in deletion studies. When the expression level of the pump genes was adjusted to a similar level for a comparison with AcrAB-TolC, we found that both A. baumannii efflux systems pumped out a wide range of compounds, but AdeABC was less effective than AcrAB-TolC in the extrusion of lipophilic $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was more effective at tetracycline efflux. AdeIJK was remarkably more effective than a similar level of AcrAB-TolC in the efflux of $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was less so in the efflux of erythromycin. These results thus allow us to compare these efflux systems on a quantitative basis, if we can assume that the heterologous systems are fully functional in the E. coli host.},

Genotyping in 440 additional genomes confirms the most common SVs in unique euchromatin are now sequence resolved. We report a ninefold SV bias toward the last 5 Mbp of human chromosomes with nearly 55{\%} of all VNTRs (variable number of tandem repeats) mapping to this portion of the genome. We identify SVs affecting coding and noncoding regulatory loci improving annotation and interpretation of functional variation.

@article{Dedeurwaerder2011,
abstract = {Aims: Studies of DNA methylomes hold enormous promise for biomedicine but are hampered by the technological challenges of analyzing many samples cost-effectively. Recently, a major extension of the previous Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip{\textregistered} (Illumina, Inc. CA, USA), called Infinium HumanMethylation450 (Infinium Methylation 450K; Illumina, Inc. CA, USA) was developed. This upgraded technology is a hybrid of two different chemical assays, the Infinium I and Infinium II assays, allowing (for 12 samples in parallel) assessment of the methylation status of more than 480,000 cytosines distributed over the whole genome. In this article, we evaluate Infinium Methylation 450K on cell lines and tissue samples, highlighting some of its advantages but also some of its limitations. In particular, we compare the methylation values of the Infinium I and Infinium II assays. Materials {\&} methods: We used Infinium Methylation 450K to profile: first, the well-characterized HCT116 wild-type and double-knockout cell lines and then, 16 breast tissue samples (including eight normal and eight primary tumor samples). Absolute methylation values ($\beta$-values) were extracted with the GenomeStudio™ software and then subjected to detailed analysis. Results: While this technology appeared highly robust as previously shown, we noticed a divergence between the $\beta$-values retrieved from the type I and type II Infinium assays. Specifically, the $\beta$-values obtained from Infinium II probes were less accurate and reproducible than those obtained from Infinium I probes. This suggests that data from the type I and type II assays should be considered separately in any downstream bioinformatic analysis. To be able to deal with the Infinium I and Infinium II data together, we developed and tested a new correction technique, which we called 'peak-based correction'. The idea was to rescale the Infinium II data on the basis of the Infinium I data. While this technique should be viewed as an approximation method, it significantly improves the quality of Infinium II data. Conclusion: Infinium 450K is a powerful technique in terms of reagent costs, time of labor, sample throughput and coverage. It holds great promise for the better understanding of the epigenetic component in health and disease. Yet, due to the nature of its design comprising two different chemical assays, analysis of the whole set of data is not as easy as initially anticipated. Correction strategies, such as the peak-based approach proposed here, are a step towards adequate output data analysis. {\textcopyright} 2011 Future Medicine Ltd.},

abstract = {Literature reviews are in great demand in most scientific fields. Their need stems from the ever-increasing output of scientific publications [1]. For example, compared to 1991, in 2008 three, eight, and forty times more papers were indexed in Web of Science on malaria, obesity, and biodiversity, respectively [2]. Given such mountains of papers, scientists cannot be expected to examine in detail every single new paper relevant to their interests [3]. Thus, it is both advantageous and necessary to rely on regular summaries of the recent literature. Although recognition for scientists mainly comes from primary research, timely literature reviews can lead to new synthetic insights and are often widely read [4]. For such summaries to be useful, however, they need to be compiled in a professional way [5]. When starting from scratch, reviewing the literature can require a titanic amount of work. That is why researchers who have spent their career working on a certain research issue are in a perfect position to review that literature. Some graduate schools are now offering courses in reviewing the literature, given that most research students start their project by producing an overview of what has already been done on their research issue [6]. However, it is likely that most scientists have not thought in detail about how to approach and carry out a literature review. Reviewing the literature requires the ability to juggle multiple tasks, from finding and evaluating relevant material to synthesising information from various sources, from critical thinking to paraphrasing, evaluating, and citation skills [7]. In this contribution, I share ten simple rules I learned working on about 25 literature reviews as a PhD and postdoctoral student. Ideas and insights also come from discussions with coauthors and colleagues, as well as feedback from reviewers and editors.},

abstract = {We have developed a new genome scanning method (restriction landmark genomic scanning (RLGS), based on the new concept of using restriction enzyme sites as landmarks. RLGS employs direct end labeling of the genomic DNA digested with a restriction enzyme and two-dimensional electrophoresis with high-resolution. Its advantages are: (i) high-speed scanning ability, allowing simultaneous scanning of thousands of restriction landmarks; (ii) extension of the scanning field using different kinds of landmarks in an additional series of electrophoresis; (iii) application to any type of organism because of direct-labeling of restriction enzyme sites and no hybridization procedure; and (iv) reflection of the copy number of the restriction landmark by the spot intensity which enables distinction of haploid and diploid genomic DNAs. The RLGS method has various applications because it can be used to scan for physical genomic DNA states, such as amplification, deletion and methylation. The copy number of the locus of a restriction landmark can be estimated by the spot intensity to find either an amplified or deleted region. The methylation state of genomic DNA can also be discovered by use of a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme sites as a restriction landmark (restriction landmark genomic scanning for screening methylated sites, RLGS-M). This article introduces the basic principle of RLGS and its applications to the analysis of cancer, mouse mutant DNAs and tissue-specific methylation, showing the usefulness of RLGS for a variety of biological fields.},

abstract = {The genome is packaged and organized in an ordered, nonrandom manner, and specific chromatin segments contact nuclear substructures to mediate this organization. tRNA genes (tDNAs) are binding sites for transcription factors and architectural proteins and are thought to play an important role in the organization of the genome. In this study, we investigate the roles of tDNAs in genomic organization and chromosome function by editing a chromosome so that it lacked any tDNAs. Surprisingly our analyses of this tDNA-less chromosome show that loss of tDNAs does not grossly affect chromatin architecture or chromosome tethering and mobility. However, loss of tDNAs affects local nucleosome positioning and the binding of SMC proteins at these loci. The absence of tDNAs also leads to changes in centromere clustering and a reduction in the frequency of long-range HML-HMR heterochromatin clustering with concomitant effects on gene silencing. We propose that the tDNAs primarily affect local chromatin structure, which results in effects on long-range chromosome architecture.},

abstract = {DNA methylation (DNAm) is a fundamental biochemical modification which occurs over the lifespan of an individual and it is a significant component in the aging process. Methylation level of CpG sites plays an important role in finding the age of a person. Different approaches were used to extract age-related CpG (AR-CpG) sites for developing age-prediction models because the level of methylation is directly related to age for some CpG sites. Several age prediction models have been developed over the past few years and most of these models were based on regression techniques. This paper reviews and analyzes age-prediction models developed using methylated data. The first section introduces the problem of aging in humans. In the next section, the concept of DNA methylation is described in detail. Thereafter, DNA methylation based age-prediction methods are discussed. In addition to this, a summary of all these methods is also provided. Finally, some limitations of the current research along with future directions are given.},

Objective To determine whether SNPs in DHCR7, CYP2R1, CYP24A1, and GC are associated with the response to gestational cholecalciferol supplementation. Design Within-randomization group analysis of the Maternal Vitamin D Osteoporosis Study trial of antenatal cholecalciferol supplementation. Setting Hospital antenatal clinics. Participants In total, 682 women of white ethnicity (351 placebo, 331 cholecalciferol) were included. SNPs at rs12785878 (DHCR7), rs10741657 (CYP2R1), rs6013897 (CYP24A1), and rs2282679 (GC) were genotyped. Interventions 1000 IU/d cholecalciferol from 14 weeks of gestation until delivery. Main Outcome Measure 25(OH)D at randomization and 34 weeks of gestation were measured in a single batch (Liaison; Diasorin, Dartford, UK). Associations between 25(OH)D and the SNPs were assessed by linear regression using an additive model [$\beta$ represents the change in 25(OH)D per additional common allele]. Results Only rs12785878 (DHCR7) was associated with baseline 25(OH)D [$\beta$ = 3.1 nmol/L; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 1.0 to 5.2 nmol/L; P {\textless} 0.004]. In contrast, rs10741657 (CYP2R1) ($\beta$ = -5.2 nmol/L; 95{\%} CI, -8.2 to -2.2 nmol/L; P = 0.001) and rs2282679 (GC) ($\beta$ = 4.2 nmol/L; 95{\%} CI, 0.9 to 7.5 nmol/L; P = 0.01) were associated with achieved 25(OH)D status following supplementation, whereas rs12785878 and rs6013897 (CYP24A1) were not. Conclusions Genetic variation in DHCR7, which encodes 7-dehyrocholesterol reductase in the epidermal vitamin D biosynthesis pathway, appears to modify baseline 25(OH)D. In contrast, the response to antenatal cholecalciferol supplementation was associated with SNPs in CYP2R1, which may alter 25-hydroxylase activity, and GC, which may affect vitamin D binding protein synthesis or metabolite affinity.},

abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

abstract = {Analysis of DNA methylation patterns relies increasingly on sequencing-based profiling methods. The four most frequently used sequencing-based technologies are the bisulfite-based methods MethylC-seq and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), and the enrichment-based techniques methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) and methylated DNA binding domain sequencing (MBD-seq). We applied all four methods to biological replicates of human embryonic stem cells to assess their genome-wide CpG coverage, resolution, cost, concordance and the influence of CpG density and genomic context. The methylation levels assessed by the two bisulfite methods were concordant (their difference did not exceed a given threshold) for 82{\%} for CpGs and 99{\%} of the non-CpG cytosines. Using binary methylation calls, the two enrichment methods were 99{\%} concordant and regions assessed by all four methods were 97{\%} concordant. We combined MeDIP-seq with methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme (MRE-seq) sequencing for comprehensive methylome coverage at lower cost. This, along with RNA-seq and ChIP-seq of the ES cells enabled us to detect regions with allele-specific epigenetic states, identifying most known imprinted regions and new loci with monoallelic epigenetic marks and monoallelic expression.},

abstract = {Gliding motility in the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus uses two motility engines: S-motility powered by type-IV pili and A-motility powered by uncharacterized motor proteins and focal adhesion complexes. In this paper, we identified MreB, an actin-like protein, and MglA, a small GTPase of the Ras superfamily, as essential for both motility systems. A22, an inhibitor of MreB cytoskeleton assembly, reversibly inhibited S- and A-motility, causing rapid dispersal of S- and A-motility protein clusters, FrzS and AglZ. This suggests that the MreB cytoskeleton is involved in directing the positioning of these proteins. We also found that a DeltamglA motility mutant showed defective localization of AglZ and FrzS clusters. Interestingly, MglA-YFP localization mimicked both FrzS and AglZ patterns and was perturbed by A22 treatment, consistent with results indicating that both MglA and MreB bind to motility complexes. We propose that MglA and the MreB cytoskeleton act together in a pathway to localize motility proteins such as AglZ and FrzS to assemble the A-motility machineries. Interestingly, M. xanthus motility systems, like eukaryotic systems, use an actin-like protein and a small GTPase spatial regulator.},

We find that genomes are partitioned into contact domains (median length, 185 kb), which are associated with distinct patterns of histone marks and segregate into six subcompartments. We identify ∼10,000 loops. These loops frequently link promoters and enhancers, correlate with gene activation, and show conservation across cell types and species. Loop anchors typically occur at domain boundaries and bind CTCF. CTCF sites at loop anchors occur predominantly ({\textgreater}90{\%}) in a convergent orientation, with the asymmetric motifs "facing" one another. The inactive X chromosome splits into two massive domains and contains large loops anchored at CTCF-binding repeats. PaperFlick},

@article{Agarwala2012,
abstract = {For the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, nutrient limitation is a key developmental signal causing diploid cells to switch from yeast-form budding to either foraging pseudohyphal (PH) growth or meiosis and sporulation. Prolonged starvation leads to lineage restriction, such that cells exiting meiotic prophase are committed to complete sporulation even if nutrients are restored. Here, we have identified an earlier commitment point in the starvation program. After this point, cells, returned to nutrient-rich medium, entered a form of synchronous PH development that was morphologically and genetically indistinguishable from starvation-induced PH growth. We show that lineage restriction during this time was, in part, dependent on the mRNA methyltransferase activity of Ime4, which played separable roles in meiotic induction and suppression of the PH program. Normal levels of meiotic mRNA methylation required the catalytic domain of Ime4, as well as two meiotic proteins, Mum2 and Slz1, which interacted and co-immunoprecipitated with Ime4. This MIS complex (Mum2, Ime4, and Slz1) functioned in both starvation pathways. Together, our results support the notion that the yeast starvation response is an extended process that progressively restricts cell fate and reveal a broad role of post-transcriptional RNA methylation in these decisions.},

abstract = {In diploid mammalian genomes, parental alleles can exhibit different methylation patterns (allele-specific DNA methylation, ASM), which have been documented in a small number of cases except for the imprinted regions and X chromosomes in females. We carried out a chromosome-wide survey of ASM across 16 human pluripotent and adult cell lines using Illumina bisulfite sequencing. We applied the principle of linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis to characterize the correlation of methylation between adjacent CpG sites on single DNA molecules, and also investigated the correlation between CpG methylation and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We observed ASM on 23{\%} approximately 37{\%} heterozygous SNPs in any given cell line. ASM is often cell-type-specific. Furthermore, we found that a significant fraction (38{\%}-88{\%}) of ASM regions is dependent on the presence of heterozygous SNPs in CpG dinucleotides that disrupt their methylation potential. This study identified distinct types of ASM across many cell types and suggests a potential role for CpG-SNP in connecting genetic variation with the epigenome.},

Fetal and early-life environmental exposures have been associated with altered DNA methylation and play a critical role in progress of diseases in adulthood. We investigated whether exposure to indoor air pollution from solid fuels at different lifetime periods was associated with global DNA methylation and methylation at the IFG2/H19 imprinting control region (ICR) in a population-based sample of non-smoking women from Warsaw, Poland. Global methylation and IFG2/H19 ICR methylation were assessed in peripheral blood DNA from 42 non-smoking women with Luminometric Methylation Assay (LUMA) and quantitative pyrosequencing, respectively. Linear regression models were applied to estimate associations between indoor air pollution and DNA methylation in the blood. Compared to women without exposure, the levels of LUMA methylation for women who had ever exposed to both coal and wood were reduced 6.70{\%} (95{\%} CI: -13.36, -0.04). Using both coal and wood before age 20 was associated with 6.95{\%} decreased LUMA methylation (95{\%} CI: -13.79, -0.11). Further, the negative correlations were more significant with exposure to solid fuels for cooking before age 20. There were no clear associations between indoor solid fuels exposure before age 20 and through the lifetime and IFG2/H19 ICR methylation. Our study of non-smoking women supports the hypothesis that exposure to indoor air pollution from solid fuels, even early-life exposure, has the capacity to modify DNA methylation that can be detected in peripheral blood.},

abstract = {Epigenetics describes mechanisms which control gene expression and cellular processes without changing the DNA sequence. The main mechanisms in epigenetics are DNA methylation in CpG-rich promoters, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). DNA methylation modifies the function of the DNA and correlates with gene silencing. Histone modifications including acetylation/deacetylation and phosphorylation act in diverse biological processes such as transcriptional activation/inactivation and DNA repair. Non-coding RNAs play a large part in epigenetic regulation of gene expression in addition to their roles at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. Osteoporosis is the most common skeletal disorder, characterized by compromised bone strength and bone micro-architectural deterioration that predisposes the bones to an increased risk of fracture. It is most often caused by an increase in bone resorption that is not sufficiently compensated by a corresponding increase in bone formation. Nowadays it is well accepted that osteoporosis is a multifactorial disorder and there are genetic risk factors for osteoporosis and bone fractures. Here we review emerging evidence that epigenetics contributes to the machinery that can alter DNA structure, gene expression, and cellular differentiation during physiological and pathological bone remodeling.},

abstract = {Context/Objective: Bone mass is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Recent studies have highlighted associations between maternal nutritional status during pregnancy and bone mass in the offspring. We hypothesized that maternal calcium intakes and circulating micronutrients during pregnancy are related to bone mass in Indian children. Design/Setting/ Participants/Main Outcome Measures: Nutritional status was measured at 18 and 28 wk gestation in 797 pregnant rural Indian women. Measurements included anthropometry, dietary intakes (24-h recall and food frequency questionnaire), physical workload (questionnaire), and circulating micronutrients (red cell folate and plasma ferritin, vitamin B12, and vitamin C). Six years postnatally, total body and total spine bone mineral content and bone mineral density (BMD) were measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in the children (n = 698 of 762 live births) and both parents. Results: Both parents' DXA measurements were positively correlated with the equivalent measurements in the children (P {\textless} 0.001 for all). The strength of these correlations was similar for fathers and mothers. Children of mothers who had a higher frequency of intake of calcium-rich foods during pregnancy (milk, milk products, pulses, nonvegetarian foods, green leafy vegetables, fruit) had higher total and spine bone mineral content and BMD, and children of mothers with higher folate status at 28 wk gestation had higher total and spine BMD, independent of parental size and DXA measurements. Conclusions: Modifiable maternal nutritional factors may influence bone health in the offspring. Fathers play a role in determining their child's bone mass, possibly through genetic mechanisms or through shared environment. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2006 by The Endocrine Society.},

abstract = {DNA methylation is the major repression mechanism for human retrotransposons, such as the Alu family. Here, we have determined the methylation levels associated with 5238 loci belonging to two Alu subfamilies, AluYa5 and AluYb8, using high-throughput targeted repeat element bisulfite sequencing (HT-TREBS). The results indicate that ˜90{\%} of loci are repressed by high methylation levels. Of the remaining loci, many of the hypomethylated elements are found near gene promoters and show high levels of DNA methylation variation. We have characterized this variation in the context of tumorigenesis and interindividual differences. Comparison of a primary breast tumor and its matched normal tissue revealed early DNA methylation changes in ˜1{\%} of AluYb8 elements in response to tumorigenesis. Simultaneously, AluYa5/Yb8 elements proximal to promoters also showed differences in methylation of up to one order of magnitude, even between normal individuals. Overall, the current study demonstrates that early loss of methylation occurs during tumorigenesis in a subset of young Alu elements, suggesting their potential clinical relevance. However, approaches such as deep-bisulfite-sequencing of individual loci using HT-TREBS are required to distinguish clinically relevant loci from the background observed for AluYa5/Yb8 elements in general with regard to high levels of interindividual variation in DNA methylation.},

abstract = {The role of epigenetics in aging and age-related diseases is a key issue in molecular physiology and medicine because certain epigenetic factors are thought to mediate, at least in part, the relationship between the genome and the environment. An active role for epigenetics in aging must meet two prior conditions: there must be specific epigenetic changes during aging and they must be functionally associated with the aged phenotype. Assuming that specific epigenetic modifications can have a direct functional outcome in aging, it is also essential to establish whether they depend on genetic, environmental or stochastic factors, and if they can be transmitted from one generation to the next. Here we discuss current knowledge about these matters and future directions in the field.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The Illumina Infinium 450 k DNA Methylation Beadchip is a prime candidate technology for Epigenome-Wide Association Studies (EWAS). However, a difficulty associated with these beadarrays is that probes come in two different designs, characterized by widely different DNA methylation distributions and dynamic range, which may bias downstream analyses. A key statistical issue is therefore how best to adjust for the two different probe designs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here we propose a novel model-based intra-array normalization strategy for 450 k data, called BMIQ (Beta MIxture Quantile dilation), to adjust the beta-values of type2 design probes into a statistical distribution characteristic of type1 probes. The strategy involves application of a three-state beta-mixture model to assign probes to methylation states, subsequent transformation of probabilities into quantiles and finally a methylation-dependent dilation transformation to preserve the monotonicity and continuity of the data. We validate our method on cell-line data, fresh frozen and paraffin-embedded tumour tissue samples and demonstrate that BMIQ compares favourably with two competing methods. Specifically, we show that BMIQ improves the robustness of the normalization procedure, reduces the technical variation and bias of type2 probe values and successfully eliminates the type1 enrichment bias caused by the lower dynamic range of type2 probes. BMIQ will be useful as a preprocessing step for any study using the Illumina Infinium 450 k platform.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: BMIQ is freely available from http://code.google.com/p/bmiq/.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONTACT: a.teschendorff@ucl.ac.uk$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {DNA methylation plays an important role in the regulation of transcription. Genetic control of DNA methylation is a potential candidate for explaining the many identified SNP associations with disease that are not found in coding regions. We replicated 52,916 cis and 2,025 trans DNA methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) using methylation from whole blood measured on Illumina HumanMethylation450 arrays in the Brisbane Systems Genetics Study (n = 614 from 177 families) and the Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1921 and 1936 (combined n = 1366). The trans mQTL SNPs were found to be over-represented in 1 Mbp subtelomeric regions, and on chromosomes 16 and 19. There was a significant increase in trans mQTL DNA methylation sites in upstream and 5′ UTR regions. The genetic heritability of a number of complex traits and diseases was partitioned into components due to mQTL and the remainder of the genome. Significant enrichment was observed for height (p = 2.1 × 10 −10 ), ulcerative colitis (p = 2 × 10 −5 ), Crohn's disease (p = 6 × 10 −8 ) and coronary artery disease (p = 5.5 × 10 −6 ) when compared to a random sample of SNPs with matched minor allele frequency, although this enrichment is explained by the genomic location of the mQTL SNPs.},

Complex manipulation techniques and maternal stores of proteins preclude large-scale functional screens for ZGA regulators within early embryos. Here, we combined pooled CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) with single-cell transcriptomics to identify regulators of ZGA-like transcription in mouse embryonic stem cells, which serve as a tractable, in vitro proxy of early mouse embryos. Using multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA+) applied to ∼200,000 single-cell transcriptomes comprising 230 CRISPRa perturbations, we characterized molecular signatures of ZGA and uncovered 24 factors that promote a ZGA-like response. Follow-up assays validated top screen hits, including the DNA-binding protein Dppa2, the chromatin remodeler Smarca5, and the transcription factor Patz1, and functional experiments revealed that Smarca5's regulation of ZGA-like transcription is dependent on Dppa2. Together, our single-cell transcriptomic profiling of CRISPRa-perturbed cells provides both system-level and molecular insights into the mechanisms that orchestrate ZGA.},

abstract = {The ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) structural class represents the largest and most diverse family of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). Many USPs assume important biological roles and emerge as potential targets for therapeutic intervention. A clear understanding of USP catalytic mechanism requires a functional evaluation of the proposed key active site residues. Crystallographic data of ubiquitin aldehyde adducts of USP catalytic cores provided structural details on the catalytic triad residues, namely the conserved Cys and His, and a variable putative third residue, and inferred indirect structural roles for two other conserved residues (Asn and Asp), in stabilizing via a bridging water molecule the oxyanion of the tetrahedral intermediate (TI). We have expressed the catalytic domain of USP2 and probed by site-directed mutagenesis the role of these active site residues in the hydrolysis of peptide and isopeptide substrates, including a synthetic K48-linked diubiquitin substrate for which a label-free, mass spectrometry based assay has been developed to monitor cleavage. Hydrolysis of ubiquitin-AMC, a model substrate, was not affected by the mutations. Molecular dynamics simulations of USP2, free and complexed with the TI of a bona fide isopeptide substrate, were carried out. We found that Asn271 is structurally poised to directly stabilize the oxyanion developed in the acylation step, while being structurally supported by the adjacent absolutely conserved Asp575. Mutagenesis data functionally confirmed this structural role independent of the nature (isopeptide vs peptide) of the bond being cleaved. We also found that Asn574, structurally located as the third member of the catalytic triad, does not fulfill this role functionally. A dual supporting role is inferred from double-point mutation and structural data for the absolutely conserved residue Asp575, in oxyanion hole formation, and in maintaining the correct alignment and protonation of His557 for catalytic competency.},

abstract = {Small non-coding RNAs (sncRNA) are regulators of cell functions and circulating sncRNAs from the majority of RNA classes are potential non-invasive biomarkers. Understanding how common traits influence ncRNA expression is essential for assessing their biomarker potential. In this study, we identify associations between sncRNA expression and common traits (sex, age, self-reported smoking, body mass, self-reported physical activity). We used RNAseq data from 526 serum samples from the Janus Serum Bank and traits from health examination surveys. Ageing showed the strongest association with sncRNA expression, both in terms of statistical significance and number of RNAs, regardless of RNA class. piRNAs were abundant in the serum samples and they were associated to sex. Interestingly, smoking cessation generally restored RNA expression to non-smoking levels, although for some sncRNAs smoking-related expression levels persisted. Pathway analysis suggests that smoking-related sncRNAs target the cholinergic synapses and may therefore potentially play a role in smoking addiction. Our results show that common traits influence circulating sncRNA expression. It is clear that sncRNA biomarker analyses should be adjusted for age and sex. In addition, for specific sncRNAs, analyses should also be adjusted for body mass, smoking, physical activity and technical factors.},

abstract = {Evidence is accruing that environmental exposures during critical periods of early development induce persisting changes in skeletal growth, and alter fracture risk in later life. We have previously demonstrated that placental calcium transport, partly determined by maternal 25-(OH) vitamin D status, may underlie this phenomenon. However, the precise relationship between expression of calcium transport proteins in the human placenta, and neonatal bone mineral accrual in the offspring, remains unknown. Tissue samples from 70 human placentae were fast frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 70 °C. A quantitative real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to measure the mRNA expression of PMCA isoforms 1-4, using beta-actin as a control gene. Neonatal whole body bone area, mineral content and areal density (BA, BMC, BMD) were measured within 2 weeks of birth using DXA. PMCA3 mRNA expression predicted BA (r = 0.28, p = 0.02), BMC (r = 0.25, p = 0.04), placental weight (r = 0.26, p = 0.04) and birth weight (r = 0.33, p = 0.006) of the neonate. In a multivariate model, the relationship between placental PMCA3 expression and neonatal BMC was independent of maternal height, pre-pregnant fat stores, parity, physical activity, smoking, and calcium intake (p {\textless} 0.05). Expression of the placental calcium transporter PMCA3 mRNA predicts neonatal whole body bone mineral content. This association may explain, in part, the mechanism whereby a mother's 25(OH)-vitamin D stores influence her offspring's bone mass. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

A genome search was carried out for 12 Gram-negative genomes and one Gram-positive genome. The results for Escherichia coli K12 were compared with new experimental data, and the predictions by the HMM agree well with the experimentally verified lipoproteins.

abstract = {The genomic loci occupied by RNA polymerase (RNAP) III have been characterized in human culture cells by genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitations, followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq). These studies have shown that only ∼40{\%} of the annotated 622 human tRNA genes and pseudogenes are occupied by RNAP-III, and that these genes are often in open chromatin regions rich in active RNAP-II transcription units. We have used ChIP-seq to characterize RNAP-III-occupied loci in a differentiated tissue, the mouse liver. Our studies define the mouse liver RNAP-III-occupied loci including a conserved mammalian interspersed repeat (MIR) as a potential regulator of an RNAP-III subunit-encoding gene. They reveal that synteny relationships can be established between a number of human and mouse RNAP-III genes, and that the expression levels of these genes are significantly linked. They establish that variations within the A and B promoter boxes, as well as the strength of the terminator sequence, can strongly affect RNAP-III occupancy of tRNA genes. They reveal correlations with various genomic features that explain the observed variation of 81{\%} of tRNA scores. In mouse liver, loci represented in the NCBI37/mm9 genome assembly that are clearly occupied by RNAP-III comprise 50 Rn5s (5S RNA) genes, 14 known non-tRNA RNAP-III genes, nine Rn4.5s (4.5S RNA) genes, and 29 SINEs. Moreover, out of the 433 annotated tRNA genes, half are occupied by RNAP-III. Transfer RNA gene expression levels reflect both an underlying genomic organization conserved in dividing human culture cells and resting mouse liver cells, and the particular promoter and terminator strengths of individual genes.},

abstract = {DNA methylation is the most studied epigenetic mark and CpG methylation is central to many biological processes and human diseases. Since cancer has highlighted the contribution to disease of aberrant DNA methylation patterns, such as the presence of promoter CpG island hypermethylation-associated silencing of tumor suppressor genes and global DNA hypomethylation defects, their importance will surely become apparent in other pathologies. However, advances in obtaining comprehensive DNA methylomes are hampered by the high cost and time-consuming aspects of the single nucleotide methods currently available for whole genome DNA methylation analyses. Following the success of the standard CpG methylation microarrays for 1,505 CpG sites and 27,000 CpG sites, we have validated in vivo the newly developed 450,000 (450K) cytosine microarray (Illumina). The 450K microarray includes CpG and CNG sites, CpG islands/shores/shelves/open sea, non-coding RNA (microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs) and sites surrounding the transcription start sites (-200 bp to -1,500 bp, 5'-UTRs and exons 1) for coding genes, but also for the corresponding gene bodies and 3'-UTRs, in addition to intergenic regions derived from GWAS studies. Herein, we demonstrate that the 450K DNA methylation array can consistently and significantly detect CpG methylation changes in the HCT-116 colorectal cancer cell line in comparison with normal colon mucosa or HCT-116 cells with defective DNA methyltransferases (DKO). The provided validation highlights the potential use of the 450K DNA methylation microarray as a useful tool for ongoing and newly designed epigenome projects.},

abstract = {Insulators help separate active chromatin domains from silenced ones. In yeast, gene promoters act as insulators to block the spread of Sir and HP1 mediated silencing while in metazoans most insulators are multipartite autonomous entities. tDNAs are repetitive sequences dispersed throughout the human genome and we now show that some of these tDNAs can function as insulators in human cells. Using computational methods, we identified putative human tDNA insulators. Using silencer blocking, transgene protection and repressor blocking assays we show that some of these tDNA-containing fragments can function as barrier insulators in human cells. We find that these elements also have the ability to block enhancers from activating RNA pol II transcribed promoters. Characterization of a putative tDNA insulator in human cells reveals that the site possesses chromatin signatures similar to those observed at other better-characterized eukaryotic insulators. Enhanced 4C analysis demonstrates that the tDNA insulator makes long-range chromatin contacts with other tDNAs and ETC sites but not with intervening or flanking RNA pol II transcribed genes.},

abstract = {Autophagy involves de novo formation of double membrane-bound structures called autophagosomes, which engulf material to be degraded in lytic compartments. Atg8 is a ubiquitin-like protein required for this process in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that can be conjugated to the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine by a ubiquitin-like system. Here, we show using an in vitro system that Atg8 mediates the tethering and hemifusion of membranes, which are evoked by the lipidation of the protein and reversibly modulated by the deconjugation enzyme Atg4. Mutational analyses suggest that membrane tethering and hemifusion observed in vitro represent an authentic function of Atg8 in autophagosome formation in vivo. In addition, electron microscopic analyses indicate that these functions of Atg8 are involved in the expansion of autophagosomal membranes. Our results provide further insights into the mechanisms underlying the unique membrane dynamics of autophagy and also indicate the functional versatility of ubiquitin-like proteins.},

abstract = {tRNAs have been discovered in the late 1950-ies of the last century and have subsequently been characterized biochemically, genetically and structurally as amino-acid delivering molecules for protein biosynthesis. First reports of stable tRNA-derived cleavage products have been reported in the late 1970-ies (1), but at that time they were mostly regarded as functionless degradation products. The advent of high-throughput sequencing techniques in the last years allowed the discovery of an unforeseen variety of small non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including tRNA-derived RNA fragments (typically referred to as tdRs or tRFs), in all domains of life. Post-transcriptional RNA cleavage encompasses all sorts of transcripts including mRNAs as well as ncRNAs thus amplifying the biological repertoire of cellular RNomes significantly. Most of these small ncRNAs are involved in different steps of gene regulation. The most studied and well understood small ncRNA regulators are the {\~{}}22 nt long miRNA and siRNA involved in postranscriptional gene silencing, a process termed RNA interference (RNAi).},

The Alu, L1, and SVA mobile element families are still duplicating, generating variation between individual genomes. Mobile element insertions (MEI) have been identified as causes for genetic diseases, including hemophilia, neurofibromatosis, and various cancers. Here we present a comprehensive map of 7,380 MEI polymorphisms from the 1000 Genomes Project whole-genome sequencing data of 185 samples in three major populations detected with two detection methods. This catalog enables us to systematically study mutation rates, population segregation, genomic distribution, and functional properties of MEI polymorphisms and to compare MEI to SNP variation from the same individuals. Population allele frequencies of MEI and SNPs are described, broadly, by the same neutral ancestral processes despite vastly different mutation mechanisms and rates, except in coding regions where MEI are virtually absent, presumably due to strong negative selection. A direct comparison of MEI and SNP diversity levels suggests a differential mobile element insertion rate among populations. {\textcopyright} 2011 Stewart et al.},

abstract = {Currently, quantitative RNA-seq methods are pushed to work with increasingly small starting amounts of RNA that require amplification. However, it is unclear how much noise or bias amplification introduces and how this affects precision and accuracy of RNA quantification. To assess the effects of amplification, reads that originated from the same RNA molecule (PCR-duplicates) need to be identified. Computationally, read duplicates are defined by their mapping position, which does not distinguish PCR- from natural duplicates and hence it is unclear how to treat duplicated reads. Here, we generate and analyse RNA-seq data sets prepared using three different protocols (Smart-Seq, TruSeq and UMI-seq). We find that a large fraction of computationally identified read duplicates are not PCR duplicates and can be explained by sampling and fragmentation bias. Consequently, the computational removal of duplicates does improve neither accuracy nor precision and can actually worsen the power and the False Discovery Rate (FDR) for differential gene expression. Even when duplicates are experimentally identified by unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), power and FDR are only mildly improved. However, the pooling of samples as made possible by the early barcoding of the UMI-protocol leads to an appreciable increase in the power to detect differentially expressed genes.},

abstract = {Histone modifications have been implicated in stem cell maintenance and differentiation. We have analyzed genome-wide changes in gene expression and histone modifications during differentiation of multipotent human primary hematopoietic stem cells/progenitor cells (HSCs/HPCs) into erythrocyte precursors. Our data indicate that H3K4me1, H3K9me1, and H3K27me1 associate with enhancers of differentiation genes prior to their activation and correlate with basal expression, suggesting that these monomethylations are involved in the maintenance of activation potential required for differentiation. In addition, although the majority of genes associated with both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in HSCs/HPCs become silent and lose H3K4me3 after differentiation, those that lose H3K27me3 and become activated after differentiation are associated with increased levels of H2A.Z, H3K4me1, H3K9me1, H4K20me1, and RNA polymerase II in HSCs/HPCs. Thus, our data suggest that gene expression changes during differentiation are programmed by chromatin modifications present at the HSC/HPC stage and provide a resource for enhancer and promoter identification. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Mansell2019,
abstract = {Background: There has been a steady increase in the number of studies aiming to identify DNA methylation differences associated with complex phenotypes. Many of the challenges of epigenetic epidemiology regarding study design and interpretation have been discussed in detail, however there are analytical concerns that are outstanding and require further exploration. In this study we seek to address three analytical issues. First, we quantify the multiple testing burden and propose a standard statistical significance threshold for identifying DNA methylation sites that are associated with an outcome. Second, we establish whether linear regression, the chosen statistical tool for the majority of studies, is appropriate and whether it is biased by the underlying distribution of DNA methylation data. Finally, we assess the sample size required for adequately powered DNA methylation association studies. Results: We quantified DNA methylation in the Understanding Society cohort (n = 1175), a large population based study, using the Illumina EPIC array to assess the statistical properties of DNA methylation association analyses. By simulating null DNA methylation studies, we generated the distribution of p-values expected by chance and calculated the 5{\%} family-wise error for EPIC array studies to be 9 × 10- 8. Next, we tested whether the assumptions of linear regression are violated by DNA methylation data and found that the majority of sites do not satisfy the assumption of normal residuals. Nevertheless, we found no evidence that this bias influences analyses by increasing the likelihood of affected sites to be false positives. Finally, we performed power calculations for EPIC based DNA methylation studies, demonstrating that existing studies with data on ∼ 1000 samples are adequately powered to detect small differences at the majority of sites. Conclusion: We propose that a significance threshold of P {\textless} 9 × 10- 8 adequately controls the false positive rate for EPIC array DNA methylation studies. Moreover, our results indicate that linear regression is a valid statistical methodology for DNA methylation studies, despite the fact that the data do not always satisfy the assumptions of this test. These findings have implications for epidemiological-based studies of DNA methylation and provide a framework for the interpretation of findings from current and future studies.},

Until recently, available tools for introducing site-specific double strand DNA breaks were restricted to zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and TAL effector nucleases (TALENs). However, these technologies have not been widely adopted by the plant research community due to complicated design and laborious assembly of specific DNA binding proteins for each target gene. Recently, an easier method has emerged based on the bacterial type II CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas (CRISPR-associated) immune system. The CRISPR/Cas system allows targeted cleavage of genomic DNA guided by a customizable small noncoding RNA, resulting in gene modifications by both non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR) mechanisms. In this review we summarize and discuss recent applications of the CRISPR/Cas technology in plants.},

abstract = {The obesity epidemic is responsible for a substantial economic burden in developed countries and is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The disease is the result not only of several environmental risk factors, but also of genetic predisposition. To take advantage of recent advances in gene-mapping technology, we executed a genome-wide association scan to identify genetic variants associated with obesity-related quantitative traits in the genetically isolated population of Sardinia. Initial analysis suggested that several SNPs in the FTO and PFKP genes were associated with increased BMI, hip circumference, and weight. Within the FTO gene, rs9930506 showed the strongest association with BMI (p = 8.6 x10(-7)), hip circumference (p = 3.4 x 10(-8)), and weight (p = 9.1 x 10(-7)). In Sardinia, homozygotes for the rare "G" allele of this SNP (minor allele frequency = 0.46) were 1.3 BMI units heavier than homozygotes for the common "A" allele. Within the PFKP gene, rs6602024 showed very strong association with BMI (p = 4.9 x 10(-6)). Homozygotes for the rare "A" allele of this SNP (minor allele frequency = 0.12) were 1.8 BMI units heavier than homozygotes for the common "G" allele. To replicate our findings, we genotyped these two SNPs in the GenNet study. In European Americans (N = 1,496) and in Hispanic Americans (N = 839), we replicated significant association between rs9930506 in the FTO gene and BMI (p-value for meta-analysis of European American and Hispanic American follow-up samples, p = 0.001), weight (p = 0.001), and hip circumference (p = 0.0005). We did not replicate association between rs6602024 and obesity-related traits in the GenNet sample, although we found that in European Americans, Hispanic Americans, and African Americans, homozygotes for the rare "A" allele were, on average, 1.0-3.0 BMI units heavier than homozygotes for the more common "G" allele. In summary, we have completed a whole genome-association scan for three obesity-related quantitative traits and report that common genetic variants in the FTO gene are associated with substantial changes in BMI, hip circumference, and body weight. These changes could have a significant impact on the risk of obesity-related morbidity in the general population.},

Objective: Our objective was to assess rates of bone loss at each stage of the transition and examine major factors that modify those rates. Design, Setting, and Participants: We conducted a longitudinal cohort study of 1902 African-American, Caucasian, Chinese, or Japanese women participating in The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation. Women were pre- or early perimenopausal at baseline. Outcome Measure: We assessed bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine and total hip across a maximum of six annual visits. Results: There was little change in BMD during the pre- or early perimenopause. BMD declined substantially in the late perimenopause, with an average loss of 0.018 and 0.010 g/cm2{\textperiodcentered}yr from the spine and hip, respectively (P {\textless} 0.001 for both). In the postmenopause, rates of loss from the spine and hip were 0.022 and 0.013 g/cm2{\textperiodcentered}yr, respectively (P {\textless} 0.001 for both). During the late peri- and postmenopause, bone loss was approximately 35-55{\%} slower in women in the top vs. the bottom tertile of body weight. Apparent ethnic differences in rates of spine bone loss were largely explained by differences in body weight. Conclusions: Bone loss accelerates substantially in the late perimenopause and continues at a similar pace in the first postmenopausal years. Body weight is a major determinant of the rate of menopausal BMD loss, whereas ethnicity, per se, is not. Healthcare providers should consider this information when deciding when to screen women for osteoporosis. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2008 by The Endocrine Society.},

These clocks are acknowledged as a highly accurate molecular correlate of chronological age in humans and other vertebrates. Also, extensive research is aimed at their potential to quantify biological aging rates and test longevity or rejuvenating interventions. Here, we discuss key challenges to understand clock mechanisms and biomarker utility. This requires dissecting the drivers and regulators of age-related changes in single-cell, tissue- and disease-specific models, as well as exploring other epigenomic marks, longitudinal and diverse population studies, and non-human models. We also highlight important ethical issues in forensic age determination and predicting the trajectory of biological aging in an individual.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a potent intracellular degradation process with pivotal roles in health and disease. Atg8, a lipid-conjugated ubiquitin-like protein, is required for the formation of autophagosomes, double-membrane vesicles responsible for the delivery of cytoplasmic material to lysosomes. How and when Atg8 functions in this process, however, is not clear. Here we show that Atg8 controls the expansion of the autophagosome precursor, the phagophore, and give the first real-time, observation-based temporal dissection of the autophagosome formation process. We demonstrate that the amount of Atg8 determines the size of autophagosomes. During autophagosome biogenesis, Atg8 forms an expanding structure and later dissociates from the site of vesicle formation. On the basis of the dynamics of Atg8, we present a multistage model of autophagosome formation. This model provides a foundation for future analyses of the functions and dynamics of known autophagy-related proteins and for screening new genes.},

abstract = {Aging is a complex biological process regulated by multiple cellular pathways and molecular mechanisms including epigenetics. Using genome-wide DNA methylation data measured in a large collection of Scottish old individuals, we performed discovery association analysis to identify age-methylated CpGs and replicated them in two independent Danish cohorts. The double-replicated CpGs were characterized by distribution over gene regions and location in relation to CpG islands. The replicated CpGs were further characterized by involvement in biological pathways to study their functional implications in aging. We identified 67,604 age-associated CpG sites reaching genome-wide significance of FWER {\textless}0.05, 86{\%} demethylated with increasing age. Double-replication resulted in 5,168 CpGs (39{\%} age-methylated and 61{\%} age-demethylated) which were characterized by high concentration of age-methylated CpGs at 1stExon and TSS200 and a dominant pattern of age-demethylated CpGs at other gene regions, and by overwhelming age-related methylation in CpG islands and demethylation at shore/shelf and open sea. The differential distribution patterns over gene regions for methylated and demethylated CpGs both relate to reduced gene activity during aging. Pathway analysis showed that age-dependent methylations were especially involved in cellular signalling activities while demethylations particularly linked to functions of the extracellular matrix, all implicated in the aging process and age-related disease risk.},

abstract = {The central problem faced by DNA binding proteins is how to select the correct DNA sequence from the sea of nonspecific sequences in a cell. The problem is particularly acute for bacterial restriction enzymes because cleavage at an incorrect DNA site could be lethal. To understand the basis of this selectivity, we report here the crystal structure of endonuclease BamHI bound to noncognate DNA. We show that, despite only a single base pair change in the recognition sequence, the enzyme adopts an open configuration that is on the pathway between free and specifically bound forms of the enzyme. Surprisingly, the DNA drops out of the binding cleft with a total loss of base-specific and backbone contacts. Taken together, the structure provides a remarkable snapshot of an enzyme poised for linear diffusion (rather than cleavage) along the DNA.},

abstract = {The human mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) encodes twenty-two tRNAs (mt-tRNAs) that are necessary for the intraorganellar translation of the thirteen mtDNA-encoded subunits of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. Maturation of mt-tRNAs involves 5' and 3' nucleolytic excision from precursor RNAs, as well as extensive post-transcriptional modifications. Recent data suggest that over 7 {\%} of all mt-tRNA residues in mammals undergo post-transcriptional modification, with over 30 different modified mt-tRNA positions so far described. These processing and modification steps are necessary for proper mt-tRNA function, and are performed by dedicated, nuclear-encoded enzymes. Recent growing evidence suggests that mutations in these nuclear genes, leading to incorrect maturation of mt-tRNAs, are a cause of human mitochondrial disease. Furthermore, mtDNA mutations in mt-tRNA genes, which may also affect mt-tRNA function, processing and modification, are also frequently associated with human disease. In theory, all pathogenic mt-tRNA variants should be expected to affect only a single process, which is mitochondrial translation, albeit to various extents. However, the clinical manifestations of mitochondrial disorders linked to mutations in mt-tRNAs are extremely heterogeneous, ranging from defects of a single tissue to complex multisystem disorders. This review focuses on the current knowledge of nuclear genes coding for proteins involved in mt-tRNA maturation that have been linked to human mitochondrial pathologies. We further discuss the possibility that tissue specific regulation of mt-tRNA modifying enzymes could play an important role in the clinical heterogeneity observed for mitochondrial diseases caused by mutations in mt tRNA genes.},

abstract = {The content of 5-methylcytosine in sequences of various repetition degree obtained from some mammalian (rat, mouse, cow) DNAs has been studied. The minimal 5-methylcytosine content - about 0.8 mol{\%} - is characteristic of unique DNA sequences of all DNAs studied; the maximal 5-methylcytosine content, usually exceeding 2 mol{\%}, is found in most highly repeated sequences. The 5-methylcytosine content in low repetitive (10--1000-fold) sequences, which are known to contain genes for rRNA, tRNA and histones, is markedly higher than in unique sequences. In total DNAs of vertebrates, as well as in mammalian DNA fractions, 5-methylcytosine occurs at almost the same frequency as does dinucleotide (5')-CG-(3'). This suggests that a greater part (if not all) of 5-methylcytosine in mammalian DNAs is a product of DNA methylases which recognize the (5')-CG-(3') DNA sequence. In cows the 5-methylcytosine content in reiterated DNA sequences decreases in thymus and heart with age and in lymphocytes on chronic lympholeukosis. The methylation degree of reiterated sequences increases in rat liver DNA after administration of hydrocortisone. On the contrary, in all cases the extent of methylation of unique sequences hardly ever changes, which seems to result from nearly complete methylation of cytosine residues in sequence (5')-CG-(3'). Specific changes observed in tissue on methylation of reiterated DNA sequences on aging, leukosis and hormone treatment support the idea that DNA methylation is associated with cellular differentiation or transformation and may be one of the possible mechanisms for regulation of transcription and replication in eukaryotes.},

One often overlooked complication with such studies is batch effects, which occur because measurements are affected by laboratory conditions, reagent lots and personnel differences. This becomes a major problem when batch effects are correlated with an outcome of interest and lead to incorrect conclusions. Using both published studies and our own analyses, we argue that batch effects (as well as other technical and biological artefacts) are widespread and critical to address.

abstract = {We analysed primary breast cancers by genomic DNA copy number arrays, DNA methylation, exome sequencing, messenger RNA arrays, microRNA sequencing and reverse-phase protein arrays. Our ability to integrate information across platforms provided key insights into previously defined gene expression subtypes and demonstrated the existence of four main breast cancer classes when combining data from five platforms, each of which shows significant molecular heterogeneity. Somatic mutations in only three genes (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at {\textgreater}10{\%} incidence across all breast cancers; however, there were numerous subtype-associated and novel gene mutations including the enrichment of specific mutations in GATA3, PIK3CA and MAP3K1 with the luminal A subtype. We identified two novel protein-expression-defined subgroups, possibly produced by stromal/microenvironmental elements, and integrated analyses identified specific signalling pathways dominant in each molecular subtype including a HER2/phosphorylated HER2/EGFR/phosphorylated EGFR signature within the HER2-enriched expression subtype. Comparison of basal-like breast tumours with high-grade serous ovarian tumours showed many molecular commonalities, indicating a related aetiology and similar therapeutic opportunities. The biological finding of the four main breast cancer subtypes caused by different subsets of genetic and epigenetic abnormalities raises the hypothesis that much of the clinically observable plasticity and heterogeneity occurs within, and not across, these major biological subtypes of breast cancer.},

abstract = {In mammals, DNA methylation occurs mainly at CpG dinucleotides. Methylation of the promoter suppresses gene expression, but the functional role of gene-body DNA methylation in highly expressed genes has yet to be clarified. Here we show that, in mouse embryonic stem cells, Dnmt3b-dependent intragenic DNA methylation protects the gene body from spurious RNA polymerase II entry and cryptic transcription initiation. Using different genome-wide approaches, we demonstrate that this Dnmt3b function is dependent on its enzymatic activity and recruitment to the gene body by H3K36me3. Furthermore, the spurious transcripts can either be degraded by the RNA exosome complex or capped, polyadenylated, and delivered to the ribosome to produce aberrant proteins. Elongating RNA polymerase II therefore triggers an epigenetic crosstalk mechanism that involves SetD2, H3K36me3, Dnmt3b and DNA methylation to ensure the fidelity of gene transcription initiation, with implications for intragenic hypomethylation in cancer.},

Utilizing a bone marrow transplant model with a barcoded microRNA library, we screened for barcode abundance in peripheral blood of recipient mice before and after 5-fluorouracil treatment. Overexpression of screen-candidate miR-150 resulted in significantly slowed recovery rates across major blood lineages, with associated impairment of bone marrow clonogenic potential. Conversely, platelets and myeloid cells from miR-150 null marrow recovered faster after 5-fluorouracil treatment. Heterozygous knockout of c-myb, a conserved target of miR-150, partially phenocopied miR-150-forced expression. Our data highlight the role of microRNAs in controlling hematopoietic injury response and demonstrate the power of in vivo functional screens for studying microRNAs in normal tissue physiology.},

abstract = {Cellular senescence, a stress-induced irreversible growth arrest often characterized by expression of p16(Ink4a) (encoded by the Ink4a/Arf locus, also known as Cdkn2a) and a distinctive secretory phenotype, prevents the proliferation of preneoplastic cells and has beneficial roles in tissue remodelling during embryogenesis and wound healing. Senescent cells accumulate in various tissues and organs over time, and have been speculated to have a role in ageing. To explore the physiological relevance and consequences of naturally occurring senescent cells, here we use a previously established transgene, INK-ATTAC, to induce apoptosis in p16(Ink4a)-expressing cells of wild-type mice by injection of AP20187 twice a week starting at one year of age. We show that compared to vehicle alone, AP20187 treatment extended median lifespan in both male and female mice of two distinct genetic backgrounds. The clearance of p16(Ink4a)-positive cells delayed tumorigenesis and attenuated age-related deterioration of several organs without apparent side effects, including kidney, heart and fat, where clearance preserved the functionality of glomeruli, cardio-protective KATP channels and adipocytes, respectively. Thus, p16(Ink4a)-positive cells that accumulate during adulthood negatively influence lifespan and promote age-dependent changes in several organs, and their therapeutic removal may be an attractive approach to extend healthy lifespan.},

abstract = {Metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC) is the leading cause of CRC-associated mortality. Angiogenin (ANG), a member of the ribonuclease A superfamily, not only activates endothelial cells to induce tumor angiogenesis, but also targets tumor cells to promote cell survival, proliferation, and/or migration. However, its clinical significance and underlying mechanism in CRC metastasis are still largely unknown. Here, we reported that ANG were upregulated in CRC tissues and associated with metastasis in CRC patients. We then revealed that ANG enhanced CRC growth and metastasis both in in vitro and in vivo systems. Intriguingly, we characterized a bunch of tRNA-derived stress-induced small RNAs (tiRNAs), produced through ANG cleavage, was enriched in both CRC tumor tissues and highly metastatic cells, and functioned in ANG-promoted CRC metastasis. Moreover, higher level of a 5'-tiRNA from mature tRNA-Val (5'-tiRNA-Val) was observed in CRC patients and was correlated with tumor metastasis. Taken together, we propose that a novel ANG-tiRNAs-cell migration and invasion regulatory axis promotes CRC metastasis, which might be of potential target for CRC diagnosis and treatment.

Defective autophagy plays a significant role in human pathologies, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and infectious diseases. We present our current knowledge on the key genes composing the autophagy machinery in eukaryotes from yeast to mammalian cells and the signaling pathways that sense the status of different types of stress and induce autophagy for cell survival and homeostasis.

abstract = {As organisms age, cells accumulate genetic and epigenetic errors that eventually lead to impaired organ function or catastrophic transformation such as cancer. Because aging reflects a stochastic process of increasing disorder, cells in an organ will be individually affected in different ways, thus rendering bulk analyses of postmitotic adult cells difficult to interpret. Here, we directly measure the effects of aging in human tissue by performing single-cell transcriptome analysis of 2,544 human pancreas cells from eight donors spanning six decades of life. We find that islet endocrine cells from older donors display increased levels of transcriptional noise and potential fate drift. By determining the mutational history of individual cells, we uncover a novel mutational signature in healthy aging endocrine cells. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from primary cells to derive insights into genetic and transcriptional processes that operate on aging human tissue. Aging is associated with increased transcriptional dysregulation and loss of identity at the single-cell level},

abstract = {Plasma concentrations of biologically active vitamin D (1,25-(OH)(2)D) are tightly controlled via feedback regulation of renal 1alpha-hydroxylase (CYP27B1; positive) and 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1; catabolic) enzymes. In pregnancy, this regulation is uncoupled, and 1,25-(OH)(2)D levels are significantly elevated, suggesting a role in pregnancy progression. Epigenetic regulation of CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 has previously been described in cell and animal models, and despite emerging evidence for a critical role of epigenetics in placentation generally, little is known about the regulation of enzymes modulating vitamin D homeostasis at the fetomaternal interface. In this study, we investigated the methylation status of genes regulating vitamin D bioavailability and activity in the placenta. No methylation of the VDR (vitamin D receptor) and CYP27B1 genes was found in any placental tissues. In contrast, the CYP24A1 gene is methylated in human placenta, purified cytotrophoblasts, and primary and cultured chorionic villus sampling tissue. No methylation was detected in any somatic human tissue tested. Methylation was also evident in marmoset and mouse placental tissue. All three genes were hypermethylated in choriocarcinoma cell lines, highlighting the role of vitamin D deregulation in this cancer. Gene expression analysis confirmed a reduced capacity for CYP24A1 induction with promoter methylation in primary cells and in vitro reporter analysis demonstrated that promoter methylation directly down-regulates basal promoter activity and abolishes vitamin D-mediated feedback activation. This study strongly suggests that epigenetic decoupling of vitamin D feedback catabolism plays an important role in maximizing active vitamin D bioavailability at the fetomaternal interface.},

Protein translocation across the eukaryotic host cell membrane is presumably mediated by a bacterial translocon. The structure of this predicted transmembrane complex and the mechanism of transport are far from being understood. In bacterial pathogens of animals, several putative type III secretion translocon proteins (TTPs) have been identified. Interestingly, TTP sequences are not conserved among different bacterial species, however, there are structural similarities such as transmembrane segments and coiled-coil regions. Accumulating evidence suggests that TTPs are components of oligomeric protein channels that are inserted into the host cell membrane by the TTSS.},

These methods are starting to become a bottleneck in some analysis pipelines when faced with data sets of the size of many thousands of sequences. Some methods allow computation of larger data sets while sacrificing quality, and others produce high-quality alignments, but scale badly with the number of sequences. In this paper, we describe a new program called Clustal Omega, which can align virtually any number of protein sequences quickly and that delivers accurate alignments. The accuracy of the package on smaller test cases is similar to that of the high-quality aligners. On larger data sets, Clustal Omega outperforms other packages in terms of execution time and quality. Clustal Omega also has powerful features for adding sequences to and exploiting information in existing alignments, making use of the vast amount of precomputed information in public databases like Pfam.},

abstract = {Antibodies provide effective antiviral immunity despite the fact that viruses escape into cells when they infect. Here we show that antibodies remain attached to viruses after cell infection and mediate an intracellular immune response that disables virions in the cytosol. We have discovered that cells possess a cytosolic IgG receptor, tripartite motif-containing 21 (TRIM21), which binds to antibodies with a higher affinity than any other IgG receptor in the human body. TRIM21 rapidly recruits to incoming antibody-bound virus and targets it to the proteasome via its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Proteasomal targeting leads to rapid degradation of virions in the cytosol before translation of virally encoded genes. Infection experiments demonstrate that at physiological antibody concentrations TRIM21 neutralizes viral infection. These results reveal an intracellular arm of adaptive immunity in which the protection mediated by antibodies does not end at the cell membrane but continues inside the cell to provide a last line of defense against infection.},

abstract = {Aging is accompanied by the functional decline of tissues. However, a systematic study of epigenomic and transcriptomic changes across tissues during aging is missing. Here we generated chromatin maps and transcriptomes from 4 tissues and one cell type from young, middle-age, and old mice, yielding 143 high-quality datasets. We focused specifically on chromatin marks linked to gene expression regulation and cell identity: histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), a mark enriched at promoters, and histone H3 acetylation at lysine 27 (H3K27ac), a mark enriched at active enhancers. Epigenomic and transcriptomic landscapes could easily distinguish between ages. Machine learning analysis showed that chromatin states could predict transcriptional changes during aging. Analysis of datasets from all tissues identified recurrent age-related chromatin and transcriptional changes in key processes, including the upregulation of immune system response pathways, including the interferon signaling pathway. The upregulation of interferon response pathway with age was accompanied by increased transcription of various endogenous retroviral sequences. Pathways deregulated during mouse aging across tissues, notably innate immune pathways, were also deregulated with aging in other vertebrate species — African turquoise killifish, rat, and humans — indicating common signatures of age across species. To date, our dataset represents the largest multi-tissue epigenomic and transcriptomic dataset for vertebrate aging. This resource identifies chromatin and transcriptional states that are characteristic of youthful tissues, which could be leveraged to restore aspects of youthful functionality to old tissues.},

Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of untidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The incidence of hematologic cancers increases with age. These cancers are associated with recurrent somatic mutations in specific genes. We hypothesized that such mutations would be detectable in the blood of some persons who are not known to have hematologic disorders. METHODS We analyzed whole-exome sequencing data from DNA in the peripheral-blood cells of 17,182 persons who were unselected for hematologic phenotypes. We looked for somatic mutations by identifying previously characterized single-nucleotide variants and small insertions or deletions in 160 genes that are recurrently mutated in hematologic cancers. The presence of mutations was analyzed for an association with hematologic phenotypes, survival, and cardiovascular events. RESULTS Detectable somatic mutations were rare in persons younger than 40 years of age but rose appreciably in frequency with age. Among persons 70 to 79 years of age, 80 to 89 years of age, and 90 to 108 years of age, these clonal mutations were observed in 9.5{\%} (219 of 2300 persons), 11.7{\%} (37 of 317), and 18.4{\%} (19 of 103), respectively. The majority of the variants occurred in three genes: DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1. The presence of a somatic mutation was associated with an increase in the risk of hematologic cancer (hazard ratio, 11.1; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 3.9 to 32.6), an increase in all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.4; 95{\%} CI, 1.1 to 1.8), and increases in the risks of incident coronary heart disease (hazard ratio, 2.0; 95{\%} CI, 1.2 to 3.4) and ischemic stroke (hazard ratio, 2.6; 95{\%} CI, 1.4 to 4.8). CONCLUSIONS Age-related clonal hematopoiesis is a common condition that is associated with increases in the risk of hematologic cancer and in all-cause mortality, with the latter possibly due to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

abstract = {Array-based sensors provide an architecture for multi-analyte sensing. In this paper, we report a new approach for array fabrication. Sensors are made by immobilizing different reactive chemistries on the surfaces of microspheres. Sensor arrays are prepared by randomly distributing a mixture of microsphere sensors on an optical substrate containing thousands of micrometer-scale wells. The sensors occupy a different location from array to array; thus the identity of each sensor is ascertained and registered on the detector using encoding schemes, rather than by a predetermined location in the array. The approach thereby shifts the demand from fabrication to signal processing. The availability of commercial image analysis software makes such a shift both cost-effective and time efficient.},

The original version of MINTbase comprised tRFs obtained from 768 transcriptomic datasets. We used our deterministic and exhaustive tRF mining pipeline to process all of The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets (TCGA). We identified 23 413 tRFs with abundance of ≥ 1.0 reads-per-million (RPM). To facilitate further studies of tRFs by the community, we just released version 2.0 of MINTbase that contains information about 26 531 distinct human tRFs from 11 719 human datasets as of October 2017. Key new elements include: the ability to filter tRFs on-the-fly by minimum abundance thresholding; the ability to filter tRFs by tissue keywords; easy access to information about a tRF's maximum abundance and the datasets that contain it; the ability to generate relative abundance plots for tRFs across cancer types and convert them into embeddable figures; MODOMICS information about modifications of the parental tRNA, etc. Version 2.0 of MINTbase contains 15x more datasets and nearly 4x more distinct tRFs than the original version, yet continues to offer fast, interactive access to its contents.

Using deep RNA profiling in different mouse tissues, we observed that circRNAs were substantially enriched in brain and a disproportionate fraction of them were derived from host genes that encode synaptic proteins. Moreover, on the basis of separate profiling of the RNAs localized in neuronal cell bodies and neuropil, circRNAs were, on average, more enriched in the neuropil than their host gene mRNA isoforms. Using high-resolution in situ hybridization, we visualized circRNA punctae in the dendrites of neurons. Consistent with the idea that circRNAs might regulate synaptic function during development, many circRNAs changed their abundance abruptly at a time corresponding to synaptogenesis. In addition, following a homeostatic downscaling of neuronal activity many circRNAs exhibited substantial up- or downregulation. Together, our data indicate that brain circRNAs are positioned to respond to and regulate synaptic function.},

abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile genetic elements, highly enriched in heterochromatin, that constitute a large percentage of the DNA content of eukaryotic genomes. Aging in Drosophila melanogaster is characterized by loss of repressive heterochromatin structure and loss of silencing of reporter genes in constitutive heterochromatin regions. Using next-generation sequencing, we found that transcripts of many genes native to heterochromatic regions and TEs increased with age in fly heads and fat bodies. A dietary restriction regimen, known to extend life span, repressed the age-related increased expression of genes located in heterochromatin, as well as TEs. We also observed a corresponding age-associated increase in TE transposition in fly fat body cells that was delayed by dietary restriction. Furthermore, we found that manipulating genes known to affect heterochromatin structure, including overexpression of Sir2, Su(var)3-9, and Dicer-2, as well as decreased expression of Adar, mitigated age-related increases in expression of TEs. Increasing expression of either Su(var)3-9 or Dicer-2 also led to an increase in life span. Mutation of Dicer-2 led to an increase in DNA double-strand breaks. Treatment with the reverse transcriptase inhibitor 3TC resulted in decreased TE transposition as well as increased life span in TE-sensitized Dicer-2 mutants. Together, these data support the retrotransposon theory of aging, which hypothesizes that epigenetically silenced TEs become deleteriously activated as cellular defense and surveillance mechanisms break down with age. Furthermore, interventions that maintain repressive heterochromatin and preserve TE silencing may prove key to preventing damage caused by TE activation and extending healthy life span.},

However, a better prediction of chronological age implies less opportunity for biological age. Here we used 13,661 samples in the age range of 2 to 104 years from 14 cohorts measured on Illumina HumanMethylation450/EPIC arrays to perform prediction analyses using Elastic Net and Best Linear Unbiased Prediction. We show that increasing the sample size achieves a smaller prediction error and higher correlations in test datasets. Our predictors achieved prediction errors of about 4.5 years across cohorts, in contrast to {\textgreater}7 years for the widely-used Horvath and Hannum predictors. We demonstrate that smaller prediction errors provide a limit to how much variation in biological ageing can be captured by methylation and provide evidence that age predictors from small samples are prone to confounding by cell composition.},

Furthermore, we define the blood cell-specific miRNA and isomiR expression patterns and identify novel cell type specific miRNA candidates. The study provides the most comprehensive contribution to date towards a complete miRNA catalogue of human peripheral blood, which can be used as a reference for future studies.

abstract = {Cytosine-5 methylation within CpG dinucleotides is a potentially important mechanism of epigenetic influence on human traits and disease. In addition to influences of age and gender, genetic control of DNA methylation levels has recently been described. We used whole blood genomic DNA in a twin set (23 MZ twin-pairs and 23 DZ twin-pairs, N = 92) as well as healthy controls (N = 96) to investigate heritability and relationship with age and gender of selected DNA methylation profiles using readily commercially available GoldenGate bead array technology. Despite the inability to detect meaningful methylation differences in the majority of CpG loci due to tissue type and locus selection issues, we found replicable significant associations of DNA methylation with age and gender. We identified associations of genetically heritable single nucleotide polymorphisms with large differences in DNA methylation levels near the polymorphism (cis effects) as well as associations with much smaller differences in DNA methylation levels elsewhere in the human genome (trans effects). Our results demonstrate the feasibility of array-based approaches in studies of DNA methylation and highlight the vast differences between individual loci. The identification of CpG loci of which DNA methylation levels are under genetic control or are related to age or gender will facilitate further studies into the role of DNA methylation and disease.},

Nevertheless, the role of these potent anabolic hormones in the genesis of the aging phenotype remains controversial. In this chapter, we review the studies demonstrating the beneficial and deleterious effects of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1 deficiency and explore their effects on specific tissues and pathology as well as their potentially unique effects early during development. Based on this review, we conclude that the perceived contradictory roles of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1 in the genesis of the aging phenotype should not be interpreted as a controversy on whether growth hormone or insulin-like growth factor-1 increases or decreases life span but rather as an opportunity to explore the complex roles of these hormones during specific stages of the life span.},

Piwi proteins and piRNAs have been detected outside germline tissue in multiple phyla, but activity of the pathway in mammalian somatic cells has been little explored. In particular, Piwi expression has been observed in cancer cells, but nothing is known about the piRNA partners or the function of the system in these cells. We have surveyed the expression of the three human Piwi genes, Hiwi, Hili and Hiwi2, in multiple normal tissues and cancer cell lines. We find that Hiwi2 is ubiquitously expressed; in cancer cells the protein is largely restricted to the cytoplasm and is associated with translating ribosomes. Immunoprecipitation of Hiwi2 from MDAMB231 cancer cells enriches for piRNAs that are predominantly derived from processed tRNAs and expressed genes, species which can also be found in adult human testis. Our studies indicate that a Piwi-piRNA pathway is present in human somatic cells, with an uncharacterised function linked to translation. Taking this evidence together with evidence from primitive organisms, we propose that this somatic function of the pathway predates the germline functions of the pathway in modern animals.},

By cloning microRNAs, we unexpectedly obtained some tRNA fragments generated by tRNA cleavage in the anticodon loop. These tRNA fragments are present in many cell lines and different mouse tissues. In addition, various stress conditions can induce this tRNA cleavage event in mammalian cells. More importantly, angiogenin (ANG), a member of RNase A superfamily, appears to be the nuclease which cleaves tRNAs into tRNA halves in vitro and in vivo. These results imply that angiogenin plays an important physiological role in cell stress response, except for the known function of inducing angiogenesis. {\textcopyright} 2008 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.},

abstract = {There are numerous hallmarks of aging in mammals, but no unifying cause has been identified. In budding yeast, aging is associated with a loss of epigenetic information that occurs in response to genome instability, particularly DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Mammals also undergo predictable epigenetic changes with age, including alterations to DNA methylation patterns that serve as epigenetic "age" clocks, but what drives these changes is not known. Using a transgenic mouse system called "ICE" (for inducible changes to the epigenome), we show that a tissue's response to non-mutagenic DSBs reorganizes the epigenome and accelerates physiological, cognitive, and molecular changes normally seen in older mice, including advancement of the epigenetic clock. These findings implicate DSB-induced epigenetic drift as a conserved cause of aging from yeast to mammals.},

However, this approach limits the inference of methylation compared with direct bisulfite sequencing, the current gold standard for analyzing cytosine methylation at single nucleotide resolution. In this study, we used direct bisulfite sequencing to assess cytosine methylation in ancient DNA from the skeletal remains of 30 Native Americans ranging in age from approximately 230 to 4500 years before present. Unmethylated cytosines were converted to uracils by treatment with sodium bisulfite, bisulfite products of a CpG-rich retrotransposon were pyrosequenced, and C-to-T ratios were quantified for a single CpG position. We found that cytosine methylation is readily recoverable from most samples, given adequate preservation of endogenous nuclear DNA. In addition, our results indicate that the precision of cytosine methylation estimates is inversely correlated with aDNA preservation, such that samples of low DNA concentration show higher variability in measures of percent methylation than samples of high DNA concentration. In particular, samples in this study with a DNA concentration above 0.015 ng/$\mu$L generated the most consistent measures of cytosine methylation. This study presents evidence of cytosine methylation in a large collection of ancient human remains, and indicates that it is possible to analyze epigenetic patterns in ancient populations using direct bisulfite sequencing approaches.},

Recently it has become clear that the DNA and histone lysine methylation systems are highly interrelated and rely mechanistically on each other for normal chromatin function in vivo. Here we examine some of the functional links between these systems, with a particular focus on several recent discoveries suggesting how lysine methylation may help to target DNA methylation during development, and vice versa. In addition, the emerging role of non-methylated DNA found in CpG islands in defining histone lysine methylation profiles at gene regulatory elements will be discussed in the context of gene regulation.

abstract = {Structural variants are implicated in numerous diseases and make up the majority of varying nucleotides among human genomes. Here we describe an integrated set of eight structural variant classes comprising both balanced and unbalanced variants, which we constructed using short-read DNA sequencing data and statistically phased onto haplotype blocks in 26 human populations. Analysing this set, we identify numerous gene-intersecting structural variants exhibiting population stratification and describe naturally occurring homozygous gene knockouts that suggest the dispensability of a variety of human genes. We demonstrate that structural variants are enriched on haplotypes identified by genome-wide association studies and exhibit enrichment for expression quantitative trait loci. Additionally, we uncover appreciable levels of structural variant complexity at different scales, including genic loci subject to clusters of repeated rearrangement and complex structural variants with multiple breakpoints likely to have formed through individual mutational events. Our catalogue will enhance future studies into structural variant demography, functional impact and disease association.},

abstract = {Cellular senescence has long been used as a cellular model for understanding mechanisms underlying the ageing process. Compelling evidence obtained in recent years demonstrate that DNA damage is a common mediator for both replicative senescence, which is triggered by telomere shortening, and premature cellular senescence induced by various stressors such as oncogenic stress and oxidative stress. Extensive observations suggest that DNA damage accumulates with age and that this may be due to an increase in production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a decline in DNA repair capacity with age. Mutation or disrupted expression of genes that increase DNA damage often result in premature ageing. In contrast, interventions that enhance resistance to oxidative stress and attenuate DNA damage contribute towards longevity. This evidence suggests that genomic instability plays a causative role in the ageing process. However, conflicting findings exist which indicate that ROS production and oxidative damage levels of macromolecules including DNA do not always correlate with lifespan in model animals. Here we review the recent advances in addressing the role of DNA damage in cellular senescence and organismal ageing.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Epigenetic biomarkers of aging (the "epigenetic clock") have the potential to address puzzling findings surrounding mortality rates and incidence of cardio-metabolic disease such as: (1) women consistently exhibiting lower mortality than men despite having higher levels of morbidity; (2) racial/ethnic groups having different mortality rates even after adjusting for socioeconomic differences; (3) the black/white mortality cross-over effect in late adulthood; and (4) Hispanics in the United States having a longer life expectancy than Caucasians despite having a higher burden of traditional cardio-metabolic risk factors. RESULTS We analyzed blood, saliva, and brain samples from seven different racial/ethnic groups. We assessed the intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration of blood (independent of blood cell counts) and the extrinsic epigenetic aging rates of blood (dependent on blood cell counts and tracks the age of the immune system). In blood, Hispanics and Tsimane Amerindians have lower intrinsic but higher extrinsic epigenetic aging rates than Caucasians. African-Americans have lower extrinsic epigenetic aging rates than Caucasians and Hispanics but no differences were found for the intrinsic measure. Men have higher epigenetic aging rates than women in blood, saliva, and brain tissue. CONCLUSIONS Epigenetic aging rates are significantly associated with sex, race/ethnicity, and to a lesser extent with CHD risk factors, but not with incident CHD outcomes. These results may help elucidate lower than expected mortality rates observed in Hispanics, older African-Americans, and women.},

abstract = {This work identifies tRNAiMet precursors as a direct target of tumor suppressor miR-34a, and indicates that targeted suppression of tRNAiMet levels attenuates cell proliferation while inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The tRNAiMet may act as an oncogene and contribute significantly to tumorigenesis. Our findings provide conceptual and mechanistic insights into biology and cancer epigenetics and might have significant therapeutic implications. It remains unknown whether microRNA (miRNA/miR) can target transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. Here we provide evidence that miR-34a physically interacts with and functionally targets tRNAiMet precursors in both in vitro pulldown and Argonaute 2 (AGO2) cleavage assays. We find that miR-34a suppresses breast carcinogenesis, at least in part by lowering the levels of tRNAiMet through AGO2-mediated repression, consequently inhibiting the proliferation of breast cancer cells and inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, miR-34a expression is negatively correlated with tRNAiMet levels in cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we find that tRNAiMet knockdown also reduces cell proliferation while inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Conversely, ectopic expression of tRNAiMet promotes cell proliferation, inhibits apoptosis, and accelerates the S/G2 transition. Moreover, the enforced expression of modified tRNAiMet completely restores the phenotypic changes induced by miR-34a. Our results demonstrate that miR-34a directly targets tRNAiMet precursors via AGO2-mediated cleavage, and that tRNAiMet functions as an oncogene, potentially representing a target molecule for therapeutic intervention.},

abstract = {Aging is associated with widespread changes in genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation. Thousands of CpG sites whose tissue-specific methylation levels are strongly correlated with chronological age have been previously identified. However, the majority of these studies have focused primarily on cosmopolitan populations living in the developed world; it is not known if age-related patterns of DNA methylation at these loci are similar across a broad range of human genetic and ecological diversity. We investigated genome-wide methylation patterns using saliva and whole blood derived DNA from two traditionally hunting and gathering African populations: the Baka of the western Central African rainforest and the ≠Khomani San of the South African Kalahari Desert. We identify hundreds of CpG sites whose methylation levels are significantly associated with age, thousands that are significant in a meta-analysis, and replicate trends previously reported in populations of non-African descent. We confirm that an age-associated site in the gene ELOVL2 shows a remarkably congruent relationship with aging in humans, despite extensive genetic and environmental variation across populations. We also demonstrate that genotype state at methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs) can affect methylation trends at some known age-associated CpG sites. Our study explores the relationship between CpG methylation and chronological age in populations of African hunter-gatherers, who rely on different diets across diverse ecologies. While many age-related CpG sites replicate across populations, we show that considering common genetic variation at meQTLs further improves our ability to detect previously identified age associations.},

abstract = {Little is known about the functions of miRNAs in human longevity. Here, we present the first genome-wide miRNA study in long-lived individuals (LLI) who are considered a model for healthy aging. Using a microarray with 863 miRNAs we compared the expression profiles obtained from blood samples of 15 centenarians and nonagenarians (mean age 96.4 years) with those of 55 younger individuals (mean age 45.9 years). Eighty miRNAs showed aging-associated expression changes, with 16 miRNAs being up-regulated and 64 down-regulated in the LLI relative to the younger probands. Seven of the eight selected aging-related biomarkers were technically validated using quantitative RT-PCR, confirming the microarray data. Three of the eight miRNAs were further investigated in independent samples of 15 LLI and 17 younger participants (mean age 101.5 and 36.9 years, respectively). Our screening confirmed previously published miRNAs of human aging, thus reflecting the utility of the applied approach. The hierarchical clustering analysis of the miRNA microarray expression data revealed a distinct separation between the LLI and the younger controls (p-value {\textless}10(-5) ). The down-regulated miRNAs appeared as a cluster and were more often reported in the context of diseases than the up-regulated miRNAs. Moreover, many of the differentially regulated miRNAs are known to exhibit contrasting expression patterns in major age-related diseases. Further in silico analyses showed enrichment of potential targets of the down-regulated miRNAs in p53 and other cancer pathways. Altogether, synchronized miRNA-p53 activities could be involved in the prevention of tumorigenesis and the maintenance of genomic integrity during aging. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors Aging Cell {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland.},

abstract = {DNA methylation plays an important role in development of disease and the process of aging. In this study we examine DNA methylation at 476,366 sites throughout the genome of white blood cells from a population cohort (N = 421) ranging in age from 14 to 94 years old. Age affects DNA methylation at almost one third (29{\%}) of the sites (Bonferroni adjusted P-value {\textless}0.05), of which 60.5{\%} becomes hypomethylated and 39.5{\%} hypermethylated with increasing age. DNA methylation sites that are located within CpG islands (CGIs) more often become hypermethylated compared to sites outside an island. CpG sites in promoters are more unaffected by age, whereas sites in enhancers more often becomes hypo- or hypermethylated. Hypermethylated sites are overrepresented among genes that are involved in DNA binding, transcription regulation, processes of anatomical structure and developmental process and cortex neuron differentiation (P-value down to P = 9.14*10-67). By contrast, hypomethylated sites are not strongly overrepresented among any biological function or process. Our results indicate that the 23{\%} of the variation in DNA methylation is attributed chronological age, and that hypermethylation is more site-specific than hypomethylation. It appears that the change in DNA methylation partly overlap with regions that change histone modifications with age, indicating an interaction between the two major epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic modifications and change in gene expression over time most likely reflects the natural process of aging and variation between individuals might contribute to the development of age-related phenotypes and diseases such as type II diabetes, autoimmune and cardiovascular disease. {\textcopyright} 2013 Johansson et al.},

Here, we use four such age estimators to show that epigenetic aging can be reversed in humans. Using a protocol intended to regenerate the thymus, we observed protective immunological changes, improved risk indices for many age-related diseases, and a mean epigenetic age approximately 1.5 years less than baseline after 1 year of treatment (-2.5-year change compared to no treatment at the end of the study). The rate of epigenetic aging reversal relative to chronological age accelerated from -1.6 year/year from 0-9 month to -6.5 year/year from 9-12 month. The GrimAge predictor of human morbidity and mortality showed a 2-year decrease in epigenetic vs. chronological age that persisted six months after discontinuing treatment.

abstract = {To the Editor: Wholegenome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) has become an integral part of basic and clinical research and has been widely used to generate reference methylomes since 2010 (refs. 1,2). However, because of the initial high cost of a 30× WGBS methylome 3 , no saturation analysis has been performed to assess the information that can be harnessed from individual methylome features at different sequencing coverage. Consequently, the International Human Epigenome Consortium (IHEC; http://ihecepigenomes. org/research/referenceepigenomestandards/) decided to sequence reference methylomes to 30× coverage, which was believed to adequately capture the majority of the methylation signal for subsequent analyses. Here, we report the first saturation analysis for WGBS. We assessed the effect of coverage on the identification of five features that reveal key aspects of the methylome, including informative CpG sites (iCGs), differentially methylated positions (DMPs), differentially methylated regions (DMRs), blocks of comethylation (COMETs) and differentially methylated COMETs (DMCs). We carried out a downsampling analysis by sequentially removing random WGBS reads—thereby reducing coverage—to assess the loss of information for each of the above features related to coverage, resolution and complexity. Individual CpG methylation states, defined by iCGs, and methylation changes, defined by DMPs, exhibited the highest (single base) level of resolution and lowest level of complexity. In contrast, COMETs and DMCs had the lowest resolution and highest levels of feature complexity, whereas DMRs had medium resolution and complexity. On the basis of this analysis, we show that the current reference methylome coverage (30×) results in {\~{}}50{\%} loss of DMPs and is therefore only of limited use for highresolution feature analysis (e.g., DMPs). We analyzed 13 WGBS methylomes (M1–13), which are summarized},

Computational methods have been developed to predict the genomic locations of active enhancers based on histone modifications, but the accuracy and resolution of these methods remain limited. Here, we present an algorithm, regulatory element prediction based on tissue-specific local epigenetic marks (REPTILE), which integrates histone modification and whole-genome cytosine DNA methylation profiles to identify the precise location of enhancers. We tested the ability of REPTILE to identify enhancers previously validated in reporter assays. Compared with existing methods, REPTILE shows consistently superior performance across diverse cell and tissue types, and the enhancer locations are significantly more refined. We show that, by incorporating base-resolution methylation data, REPTILE greatly improves upon current methods for annotation of enhancers across a variety of cell and tissue types.

abstract = {Age-related changes in DNA methylation have been implicated in cellular senescence and longevity, yet the causes and functional consequences of these variants remain unclear. To elucidate the role of age-related epigenetic changes in healthy ageing and potential longevity, we tested for association between whole-blood DNA methylation patterns in 172 female twins aged 32 to 80 with age and age-related phenotypes. Twin-based DNA methylation levels at 26,690 CpG-sites showed evidence for mean genome-wide heritability of 18{\%}, which was supported by the identification of 1,537 CpG-sites with methylation QTLs in cis at FDR 5{\%}. We performed genome-wide analyses to discover differentially methylated regions (DMRs) for sixteen age-related phenotypes (ap-DMRs) and chronological age (a-DMRs). Epigenome-wide association scans (EWAS) identified age-related phenotype DMRs (ap-DMRs) associated with LDL (STAT5A), lung function (WT1), and maternal longevity (ARL4A, TBX20). In contrast, EWAS for chronological age identified hundreds of predominantly hyper-methylated age DMRs (490 a-DMRs at FDR 5{\%}), of which only one (TBX20) was also associated with an age-related phenotype. Therefore, the majority of age-related changes in DNA methylation are not associated with phenotypic measures of healthy ageing in later life. We replicated a large proportion of a-DMRs in a sample of 44 younger adult MZ twins aged 20 to 61, suggesting that a-DMRs may initiate at an earlier age. We next explored potential genetic and environmental mechanisms underlying a-DMRs and ap-DMRs. Genome-wide overlap across cis-meQTLs, genotype-phenotype associations, and EWAS ap-DMRs identified CpG-sites that had cis-meQTLs with evidence for genotype-phenotype association, where the CpG-site was also an ap-DMR for the same phenotype. Monozygotic twin methylation difference analyses identified one potential environmentally-mediated ap-DMR associated with total cholesterol and LDL (CSMD1). Our results suggest that in a small set of genes DNA methylation may be a candidate mechanism of mediating not only environmental, but also genetic effects on age-related phenotypes.},

abstract = {tRNAs are key players in translation and are additionally involved in a wide range of distinct cellular processes. The vital importance of tRNAs becomes evident in numerous diseases that are linked to defective tRNA molecules. It is therefore not surprising that the structural intactness of tRNAs is continuously scrutinized and defective tRNAs are eliminated. In this process, erroneous tRNAs are tagged with single-stranded RNA sequences that are recognized by degrading exonucleases. Recent discoveries have revealed that the CCA-adding enzyme – actually responsible for the de novo synthesis of the 3′-CCA end – plays an indispensable role in tRNA quality control by incorporating a second CCA triplet that is recognized as a degradation tag. In this review, we give an update on the latest findings regarding tRNA quality control that turns out to represent an interplay of the CCA-adding enzyme and RNases involved in tRNA degradation and maturation. In particular, the RNase-induced turnover of the CCA end is now recognized as a trigger for the CCA-adding enzyme to repeatedly scrutinize the structural intactness of a tRNA.

abstract = {MolProbity is a structure-validation web service that provides broad-spectrum solidly based evaluation of model quality at both the global and local levels for both proteins and nucleic acids. It relies heavily on the power and sensitivity provided by optimized hydrogen placement and all-atom contact analysis, complemented by updated versions of covalent-geometry and torsion-angle criteria. Some of the local corrections can be performed automatically in MolProbity and all of the diagnostics are presented in chart and graphical forms that help guide manual rebuilding. X-ray crystallography provides a wealth of biologically important molecular data in the form of atomic three-dimensional structures of proteins, nucleic acids and increasingly large complexes in multiple forms and states. Advances in automation, in everything from crystallization to data collection to phasing to model building to refinement, have made solving a structure using crystallography easier than ever. However, despite these improvements, local errors that can affect biological interpretation are widespread at low resolution and even high-resolution structures nearly all contain at least a few local errors such as Ramachandran outliers, flipped branched protein side chains and incorrect sugar puckers. It is critical both for the crystallographer and for the end user that there are easy and reliable methods to diagnose and correct these sorts of errors in structures. MolProbity is the authors' contribution to helping solve this problem and this article reviews its general capabilities, reports on recent enhancements and usage, and presents evidence that the resulting improvements are now beneficially affecting the global database.},

abstract = {Suppressor tRNAs bear anticodon mutations that allow them to decode premature stop codons in metabolic marker gene mRNAs, that can be used as in vivo reporters of functional tRNA biogenesis. Here, we review key components of a suppressor tRNA system specific to Schizosaccharomyces pombe and its adaptations for use to study specific steps in tRNA biogenesis. Eukaryotic tRNA biogenesis begins with transcription initiation by RNA polymerase (pol) III. The nascent pre-tRNAs must undergo folding, 5' and 3' processing to remove the leader and trailer, nuclear export, and splicing if applicable, while multiple complex chemical modifications occur throughout the process. We review evidence that precursor-tRNA processing begins with transcription termination at the oligo(T) terminator element, which forms a 3' oligo(U) tract on the nascent RNA, a sequence-specific binding site for the RNA chaperone, La protein. The processing pathway bifurcates depending on a poorly understood property of pol III termination that determines the 3' oligo(U) length and therefore the affinity for La. We thus review the pol III termination process and the factors involved including advances using gene-specific random mutagenesis by dNTP analogs that identify key residues important for transcription termination in certain pol III subunits. The review ends with a 'technical approaches' section that includes a parts lists of suppressor-tRNA alleles, strains and plasmids, and graphic examples of its diverse uses.},

abstract = {A dichotomous choice for metazoan cells is between proliferation and differentiation. Measuring tRNA pools in various cell types, we found two distinct subsets, one that is induced in proliferating cells, and repressed otherwise, and another with the opposite signature. Correspondingly, we found that genes serving cell-autonomous functions and genes involved in multicellularity obey distinct codon usage. Proliferation-induced and differentiation-induced tRNAs often carry anticodons that correspond to the codons enriched among the cell-autonomous and the multicellularity genes, respectively. Because mRNAs of cell-autonomous genes are induced in proliferation and cancer in particular, the concomitant induction of their codon-enriched tRNAs suggests coordination between transcription and translation. Histone modifications indeed change similarly in the vicinity of cell-autonomous genes and their corresponding tRNAs, and in multicellularity genes and their tRNAs, suggesting the existence of transcriptional programs coordinating tRNA supply and demand. Hence, we describe the existence of two distinct translation programs that operate during proliferation and differentiation.},

abstract = {Exon circularization has been identified from many loci in mammals, but the detailed mechanism of its biogenesis has remained elusive. By using genome-wide approaches and circular RNA recapitulation, we demonstrate that exon circularization is dependent on flanking intronic complementary sequences. Such sequences and their distribution exhibit rapid evolutionary changes, showing that exon circularization is evolutionarily dynamic. Strikingly, exon circularization efficiency can be regulated by competition between RNA pairing across flanking introns or within individual introns. Importantly, alternative formation of inverted repeated Alu pairs and the competition between them can lead to alternative circularization, resulting in multiple circular RNA transcripts produced from a single gene. Collectively, exon circularization mediated by complementary sequences in human introns and the potential to generate alternative circularization products extend the complexity of mammalian posttranscriptional regulation.},

abstract = {1,7 Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) or restriction-site associated DNA marker sequencing (RAD-seq) is a practical and cost-effective method for analysing large genomes from high diversity species. This method of sequencing, coupled with methylation-sensitive enzymes (often referred to as methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme sequencing or MRE-seq), is an effective tool to study DNA methylation in parts of the genome that are inaccessible in other sequencing techniques or are not annotated in microarray technologies. Current software tools do not fulfil all methylation-sensitive restriction sequencing assays for determining differences in DNA methylation between samples. To fill this computational need, we present msgbsR, an R package that contains tools for the analysis of methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme sequencing experiments. msgbsR can be used to identify and quantify read counts at methylated sites directly from alignment files (BAM files) and enables verification of restriction enzyme cut sites with the correct recognition sequence of the individual enzyme. In addition, msgbsR assesses DNA methylation based on read coverage, similar to RNA sequencing experiments, rather than methylation proportion and is a useful tool in analysing differential methylation on large populations. The package is fully documented and available freely online as a Bioconductor package (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/msgbsR.html). Methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme sequencing (MRE-seq), often referred to as methylation-sensitive genotype-by-sequencing (msGBS), is a cost effective next-generation sequencing method to analyse DNA meth-ylation in large genome species. Reducing genome complexity with restriction enzymes (REs) can be advan-tageous as it may reach parts of the genome inaccessible to sequence capture approaches 1},

abstract = {Alternative splicing of pre-messenger RNA is a key feature of transcriptome expansion in eukaryotic cells, yet its regulation is poorly understood. Spliceosome assembly occurs co-transcriptionally, raising the possibility that DNA structure may directly influence alternative splicing. Supporting such an association, recent reports have identified distinct histone methylation patterns, elevated nucleosome occupancy and enriched DNA methylation at exons relative to introns. Moreover, the rate of transcription elongation has been linked to alternative splicing. Here we provide the first evidence that a DNA-binding protein, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), can promote inclusion of weak upstream exons by mediating local RNA polymerase II pausing both in a mammalian model system for alternative splicing, CD45, and genome-wide. We further show that CTCF binding to CD45 exon 5 is inhibited by DNA methylation, leading to reciprocal effects on exon 5 inclusion. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for developmental regulation of splicing outcome through heritable epigenetic marks. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

To better understand the mechanisms underlying context-specific 3D chromatin structure and transcription during cellular differentiation, we generated comprehensive in situ Hi-C maps of DNA loops in human monocytes and differentiated macrophages. We demonstrate that dynamic looping events are regulatory rather than structural in nature and uncover widespread coordination of dynamic enhancer activity at preformed and acquired DNA loops. Enhancer-bound loop formation and enhancer activation of preformed loops together form multi-loop activation hubs at key macrophage genes. Activation hubs connect 3.4 enhancers per promoter and exhibit a strong enrichment for activator protein 1 (AP-1)-binding events, suggesting that multi-loop activation hubs involving cell-type-specific transcription factors represent an important class of regulatory chromatin structures for the spatiotemporal control of transcription. DNA loops bring enhancers in close proximity to their target genes. Phanstiel et al. map loops during macrophage development and reveal the formation of multi-loop hubs at key macrophage genes. Dynamic loops are enriched for AP-1, suggesting a major role in distal regulation of gene transcription during macrophage development.},

Several factors regulate the Rags, including GATOR1, a GTPase-activating protein (GAP); GATOR2, a positive regulator of unknown function; and Sestrin2, a GATOR2-interacting protein that inhibits mTORC1 signaling. We find that leucine, but not arginine, disrupts the Sestrin2-GATOR2 interaction by binding to Sestrin2 with a dissociation constant of 20 $\mu$M, which is the leucine concentration that half-maximally activates mTORC1. The leucine-binding capacity of Sestrin2 is required for leucine to activate mTORC1 in cells. These results indicate that Sestrin2 is a leucine sensor for the mTORC1 pathway.},

Many different LDL receptor mutations have been identified and characterized, demonstrating a high degree of allelic heterogeneity at this locus. The ability to identify mutant LDL receptor genes for prenatal diagnosis of homozygous FH or to study the role of the LDL receptor gene in polygenic hypercholesterolemia requires the use of closely linked RFLPs. In the present study we used 10 different RFLPs, including three newly described polymorphisms, to construct 123 independent haplotypes from 20 Caucasian American pedigrees. Our sample contained 31 different haplotypes varying in frequency from 0.8{\%} to 29.3{\%}; the five most common haplotypes account for 67.5{\%} of the sample. The heterozygosity and PIC of each site were determined, and these values disclosed that eight of the RFLPs were substantially polymorphic. Linkage-disequilibrium analysis of the haplotype data revealed strong nonrandom associations among all 10 RFLPs, especially among those sites clustered in the 3' region of the gene. Evolutionary analysis suggests the occurrence of both mutational and recombinational events in the generation of the observed haplotypes. A strategy for haplotype analysis of the LDL receptor gene in individuals of Caucasian American descent is presented.},

abstract = {The Drosophila melanogaster gene chico encodes an insulin receptor substrate that functions in an insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, insulin/IGF signaling regulates adult longevity. We found that mutation of chico extends fruit fly median life-span by up to 48{\%} in homozygotes and 36{\%} in heterozygotes. Extension of life-span was not a result of impaired oogenesis in chico females, nor was it consistently correlated with increased stress resistance. The dwarf phenotype of chico homozygotes was also unnecessary for extension of life-span. The role of insulin/IGF signaling in regulating animal aging is therefore evolutionarily conserved.},

abstract = {Methylation of CpG dinucleotides is a reversible modification of DNA that is highly prevalent throughout mammalian genomes. Recent advances generated genomic DNA methylation maps during cellular differentiation at unprecedented resolution. Combined with functional assays this revealed that dynamics in DNA methylation coincide with changes in regulatory activity and that transcription factors play an important role in shaping methylation patterns. This tightly links DNA methylation with underlying DNA sequence features and suggests that a substantial fraction of methylation changes occur downstream of gene regulation. Here we discuss our current understanding of the context-dependent readout of DNA methylation and criteria that need to be fulfilled for this modification to be instructive for gene regulation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

It will generate a textual output indicating which elements are in each intersection or are unique to a certain list. If the number of lists is lower than 7 it will also produce a graphical output in the form of a venn/Euler diagram. You have the choice between symmetric (default) or non symmetric venn diagrams. Currently you are able to calculate the intersections of at maximum 30 lists. The graphical output is produced in SVG and PNG format. Downloading the figure in SVG format will allow you to further customise it with SVG compatible software such as for instance InkScape (which is freeware). HOW? Enter files (in plain text format!) with a list of elements and/or copy-paste lists in the appropriate fields. The lists can contain only a single element on each line, but there is no limit on the number of lines. The input lists will be processed and made non-redundant (= duplicated elements in each list will be removed such that only one remains). You can make extra fields for entering files/lists by clicking the 'Add Another ...' button. The style of the graphical output can be specified in the output control section. Choose either symmetric of non-symmetric. Click 'submit' to start the analysis Cite? Unfortunately there is no publication yet describing this tool.

abstract = {In Drosophila melanogaster, ageing is slowed when insulin-like signalling is reduced: life expectancy is extended by more than 50{\%} when the insulin-like receptor (InR) or its receptor substrate (chico) are mutated, or when insulin-producing cells are ablated. But we have yet to resolve when insulin affects ageing, or whether insulin signals regulate ageing directly or indirectly through secondary hormones. Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan is also extended when insulin signalling is inhibited in certain tissues, or when repressed in adult worms, and this requires the forkhead transcription factor (FOXO) encoded by daf-16 (ref. 6). The D. melanogaster insulin-like receptor mediates phosphorylation of dFOXO, the equivalent of nematode daf-16 and mammalian FOXO3a. We demonstrate here that dFOXO regulates D. melanogaster ageing when activated in the adult pericerebral fat body. We further show that this limited activation of dFOXO reduces expression of the Drosophila insulin-like peptide dilp-2 synthesized in neurons, and represses endogenous insulin-dependent signalling in peripheral fat body. These findings suggest that autonomous and non-autonomous roles of insulin signalling combine to control ageing.},

abstract = {Wilms' tumor 1-associating protein (WTAP) is a putative splicing regulator that is thought to be required for cell cycle progression through the stabilization of cyclin A2 mRNA and mammalian early embryo development. To further understand how WTAP acts in the context of the cellular machinery, we identified its interacting proteins in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and HeLa cells using shotgun proteomics. Here we show that WTAP forms a novel protein complex including Hakai, Virilizer homolog, KIAA0853, RBM15, the arginine/serine-rich domain-containing proteins BCLAF1 and THRAP3, and certain general splicing regulators, most of which have reported roles in post-transcriptional regulation. The depletion of these respective components of the complex resulted in reduced cell proliferation along with G2/M accumulation. Double knockdown of the serine/arginine-rich (SR)-like proteins BCLAF1 and THRAP3 by siRNA resulted in a decrease in the nuclear speckle localization of WTAP, whereas the nuclear speckles were intact. Furthermore, we found that the WTAP complex regulates alternative splicing of the WTAP pre-mRNA by promoting the production of a truncated isoform, leading to a change in WTAP protein expression. Collectively, these findings show that the WTAP complex is a novel component of the RNA processing machinery, implying an important role in both posttranscriptional control and cell cycle regulation.},

Recent data suggest that modifications function synergistically to mediate biological function, and that cells may coordinately modulate modification levels for regulatory purposes. However, this area of RNA biology remains largely unexplored due to the lack of robust, high-throughput methods to quantify the extent of modification at specific sites. Recently, we developed a facile enzymatic ligation-based method for detection and quantitation of methylated 2'-hydroxyl groups within RNA. Here we exploit the principles of molecular recognition and nucleic acid chemistry to establish the experimental parameters for ligation-based detection and quantitation of pseudouridine (Psi) and N6-methyladenosine (m6A), two abundant modifications in eukaryotic rRNA/tRNA and mRNA, respectively. Detection of pseudouridylation at several sites in the large subunit rRNA derived from yeast demonstrates the feasibility of the approach for analysis of pseudouridylation in biological RNA samples.},

Recent studies, utilizing next-generation sequencing (NGS), observed haematopoietic clones in 10{\%} of 70-year olds and rarely in younger individuals. However, these studies could only detect common haematopoietic clones—40.02 variant allele fraction (VAF)—due to the error rate of NGS. To identify and characterize clonal mutations below this threshold, here we develop methods for targeted error-corrected sequencing, which enable the accurate detection of clonal mutations as rare as 0.0003 VAF. We apply these methods to study serially banked peripheral blood samples from healthy 50–60-year-old participants in the Nurses' Health Study. We observe clonal haematopoiesis, frequently harbouring mutations in DNMT3A and TET2, in 95{\%} of individuals studied. These clonal mutations are often stable longitudinally and present in multiple haematopoietic compartments, suggesting a long-lived haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell of origin.},

Recent findings also suggest that increased expression of repetitive elements beyond a threshold of tolerance can augment cancer therapy responses. Such advances, reviewed here, paint a picture in which deregulated expression of repetitive genome elements not only contributes to the development of cancer but may also provide a tumor-specific Achilles heel for cancer treatment.},

The discovery that the fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) is an m(6)A demethylase indicates that this modification is reversible and dynamically regulated, suggesting that it has regulatory roles. In addition, it has been shown that m(6)A affects cell fate decisions in yeast and plant development. Recent affinity-based m(6)A profiling in mouse and human cells further showed that this modification is a widespread mark in coding and noncoding RNA (ncRNA) transcripts and is likely dynamically regulated throughout developmental processes. Therefore, reversible RNA methylation, analogous to reversible DNA and histone modifications, may affect gene expression and cell fate decisions by modulating multiple RNA-related cellular pathways, which potentially provides rapid responses to various cellular and environmental signals, including energy and nutrient availability in mammals.},

abstract = {Methylation of cytosines at CpG sites is a common epigenetic DNA modification that can be measured by a large number of methods, now even in a genome-wide manner for hundreds of thousands of sites. The application of DNA methylation analysis is becoming widely popular in complex disorders, for example, to understand part of the "missing heritability". The DNA samples most readily available for methylation studies are derived from whole blood. However, blood consists of many functionally and developmentally distinct cell populations in varying proportions. We studied whether such variation might affect the interpretation of methylation studies based on whole blood DNA. We found in healthy male blood donors there is important variation in the methylation profiles of whole blood, mononuclear cells, granulocytes, and cells from seven selected purified lineages. CpG methylation between mononuclear cells and granulocytes differed for 22{\%} of the 8252 probes covering the selected 343 genes implicated in immune-related disorders by genome-wide association studies, and at least one probe was differentially methylated for 85{\%} of the genes, indicating that whole blood methylation results might be unintelligible. For individual genes, even if the overall methylation patterns might appear similar, a few CpG sites in the regulatory regions may have opposite methylation patterns (i.e., hypo/hyper) in the main blood cell types. We conclude that interpretation of whole blood methylation profiles should be performed with great caution and for any differences implicated in a disorder, the differences resulting from varying proportions of white blood cell types should be considered.},

abstract = {Background: Cellular senescence, a permanent state of replicative arrest in otherwise proliferating cells, is a hallmark of aging and has been linked to aging-related diseases. Many genes play a role in cellular senescence, yet a comprehensive understanding of its pathways is still lacking. Results: We develop CellAge (http://genomics.senescence.info/cells), a manually curated database of 279 human genes driving cellular senescence, and perform various integrative analyses. Genes inducing cellular senescence tend to be overexpressed with age in human tissues and are significantly overrepresented in anti-longevity and tumor-suppressor genes, while genes inhibiting cellular senescence overlap with pro-longevity and oncogenes. Furthermore, cellular senescence genes are strongly conserved in mammals but not in invertebrates. We also build cellular senescence protein-protein interaction and co-expression networks. Clusters in the networks are enriched for cell cycle and immunological processes. Network topological parameters also reveal novel potential cellular senescence regulators. Using siRNAs, we observe that all 26 candidates tested induce at least one marker of senescence with 13 genes (C9orf40, CDC25A, CDCA4, CKAP2, GTF3C4, HAUS4, IMMT, MCM7, MTHFD2, MYBL2, NEK2, NIPA2, and TCEB3) decreasing cell number, activating p16/p21, and undergoing morphological changes that resemble cellular senescence. Conclusions: Overall, our work provides a benchmark resource for researchers to study cellular senescence, and our systems biology analyses reveal new insights and gene regulators of cellular senescence.},

abstract = {Network analysis is a powerful way of modeling chromatin interactions. Assortativity is a network property used in social sciences to identify factors affecting how people establish social ties. We propose a new approach, using chromatin assortativity to integrate the epigenomic landscape of a specific cell type with its chromatin interaction network and thus investigate which proteins or chromatin marks mediate genomic contacts. We use high-resolution Promoter Capture Hi-C and Hi-Cap data as well as ChIA-PET data from mouse embryonic stem cells to investigate promoter-centered chromatin interaction networks and calculate the presence of specific epigenomic features in the chromatin fragments constituting the nodes of the network. We estimate the association of these features to the topology of four chromatin interaction networks and identify features localized in connected areas of the network. Polycomb Group proteins and associated histone marks are the features with the highest chromatin assortativity in promoter-centred networks. We then ask which features distinguish contacts amongst promoters from contacts between promoters and other genomic elements. We observe higher chromatin assortativity of the actively elongating form of RNA Polymerase 2 (RNAPII) compared to inactive forms only in interactions between promoters and other elements. Contacts among promoters, and between promoters and other elements have different characteristic epigenomic features. We identify a possible role for the elongating form of RNAPII in mediating interactions among promoters, enhancers and transcribed gene bodies. Our approach facilitates the study of multiple genome-wide epigenomic profiles, considering network topology and allowing the comparison of chromatin interaction networks.},

abstract = {MreB is a bacterial orthologue of actin that affects cell shape, polarity, and chromosome segregation. Although a significant body of work has explored its cellular functions, we know very little about the biochemical behavior of MreB. We have cloned, overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and purified untagged MreB1 from Thermotoga maritima. We have characterized the conditions that regulate its monomer-to-polymer assembly reaction, the critical concentrations of that reaction, the manner in which MreB uses nucleotides, its stability, and the structure of the assembled polymer. MreB requires a bound purine nucleotide for polymerization and rapidly hydrolyzes it following assembly. MreB assembly contains two distinct components, one that does not require divalent cations and one that does, which may comprise the nucleation and elongation phases of assembly, respectively. MreB assembly is strongly favored by increasing temperature or protein concentration but inhibited differentially by high concentrations of monovalent salts. The polymerization rate increases and the bulk critical concentration decreases with increasing temperature, but in contrast to previous reports, MreB is capable of polymerizing across a broad range of temperatures. MreB polymers are shorter and stiffer and scatter more light than eukaryotic actin filaments. Due to rapid ATP hydrolysis and phosphate release, we suggest that most assembled MreB in cells is in the ADP-bound state. Because of only moderate differences between the ATP and ADP critical concentrations, treadmilling may occur, but we do not predict dynamic instability in cells. Because of the relatively low cellular concentration of MreB and the observed structural properties of the polymer, a single MreB assembly may exist in cells.},

@article{Rudolph2016,
abstract = {Whether codon usage fine-tunes mRNA translation in mammals remains controversial, with recent papers suggesting that production of proteins in specific Gene Ontological (GO) pathways can be regulated by actively modifying the codon and anticodon pools in different cellular conditions. In this work, we compared the sequence content of genes in specific GO categories with the exonic genome background. Although a substantial fraction of variability in codon usage could be explained by random sampling, almost half of GO sets showed more variability in codon usage than expected by chance. Nevertheless, by quantifying translational efficiency in healthy and cancerous tissues in human and mouse, we demonstrated that a given tRNA pool can equally well translate many different sets of mRNAs, irrespective of their cell-type specificity. This disconnect between variations in codon usage and the stability of translational efficiency is best explained by differences in GC content between gene sets. GC variation across the mammalian genome is most likely a result of the interplay between genome repair and gene duplication mechanisms, rather than selective pressures caused by codon-driven translational rates. Consequently, codon usage differences in mammalian transcriptomes are most easily explained by well-understood mutational biases acting on the underlying genome.},

This will avoid the increasingly arduous task of extensive screening of bacteria and other microorganisms for new enzymes. Here, we report the deliberate creation of novel site-specific endonucleases by linking two different zinc finger proteins to the cleavage domain of Fok I endonuclease. Both fusion proteins are active and under optimal conditions cleave DNA in a sequence-specific manner. Thus, the modular structure of Fok I endonuclease and the zinc finger motifs makes it possible to create "artificial" nucleases that will cut DNA near a predetermined site.

Using a metric called methylation haplotype load, we performed tissue-specific methylation analysis at the block level. Subsets of informative blocks were further identified for deconvolution of heterogeneous samples. Finally, using methylation haplotypes we demonstrated quantitative estimation of tumor load and tissue-of-origin mapping in the circulating cell-free DNA of 59 patients with lung or colorectal cancer.},

abstract = {The existence of dynamic cellular phenotypes in changing environmental conditions is of major interest for cell biologists who aim to understand the mechanism and sequence of regulation of gene expression. In the context of therapeutic protein production by Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, a detailed temporal understanding of cell-line behavior and control is necessary to achieve a more predictable and reliable process performance. Of particular interest are data on dynamic, temporally resolved transcriptional regulation of genes in response to altered substrate availability and culture conditions. In this study, the gene transcription dynamics throughout a 9-day batch culture of CHO cells was examined by analyzing histone modifications and gene expression profiles in regular 12- and 24-hr intervals, respectively. Three levels of regulation were observed: (a) the presence or absence of DNA methylation in the promoter region provides an ON/OFF switch; (b) a temporally resolved correlation is observed between the presence of active transcription- and promoter-specific histone marks and the expression level of the respective genes; and (c) a major mechanism of gene regulation is identified by interaction of coding genes with long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), as observed in the regulation of the expression level of both neighboring coding/lnc gene pairs and of gene pairs where the lncRNA is able to form RNA–DNA–DNA triplexes. Such triplex-forming regions were predominantly found in the promoter or enhancer region of the targeted coding gene. Significantly, the coding genes with the highest degree of variation in expression during the batch culture are characterized by a larger number of possible triplex-forming interactions with differentially expressed lncRNAs. This indicates a specific role of lncRNA-triplexes in enabling rapid and large changes in transcription. A more comprehensive understanding of these regulatory mechanisms will provide an opportunity for new tools to control cellular behavior and to engineer enhanced phenotypes.},

abstract = {Selenocysteine (Sec) is known as the 21st amino acid, a cysteine analogue with selenium replacing sulphur. Sec is inserted co-translationally in a small fraction of proteins called selenoproteins. In selenoprotein genes, the Sec specific tRNA (tRNASec) drives the recoding of highly specific UGA codons from stop signals to Sec. Although found in organisms from the three domains of life, Sec is not universal. Many species are completely devoid of selenoprotein genes and lack the ability to synthesize Sec. Since tRNASec is a key component in selenoprotein biosynthesis, its efficient identification in genomes is instrumental to characterize the utilization of Sec across lineages. Available tRNA prediction methods fail to accurately predict tRNASec, due to its unusual structural fold. Here, we present Secmarker, a method based on manually curated covariance models capturing the specific tRNASec structure in archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes. We exploited the non-universality of Sec to build a proper benchmark set for tRNASec predictions, which is not possible for the predictions of other tRNAs. We show that Secmarker greatly improves the accuracy of previously existing methods constituting a valuable tool to identify tRNASec genes, and to efficiently determine whether a genome contains selenoproteins. We used Secmarker to analyze a large set of fully sequenced genomes, and the results revealed new insights in the biology of tRNASec, led to the discovery of a novel bacterial selenoprotein family, and shed additional light on the phylogenetic distribution of selenoprotein containing genomes. Secmarker is freely accessible for download, or online analysis through a web server at http://secmarker.crg.cat.},

Here, we report the crystal structures of catalytically inert human Atg4B (HsAtg4B) in complex with processed and unprocessed forms of LC3, a mammalian orthologue of yeast Atg8. On LC3 binding, the regulatory loop and the N-terminal tail of HsAtg4B undergo large conformational changes. The regulatory loop masking the entrance of the active site of free HsAtg4B is lifted by LC3 Phe119, so that a groove is formed along which the LC3 tail enters the active site. At the same time, the N-terminal tail masking the exit of the active site of HsAtg4B in the free form is detached from the enzyme core and a large flat surface is exposed, which might enable the enzyme to access the membrane-bound LC3-PE.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Genome sequencing of large three-generation families allows de novo mutations to be identified in the second generation, validated and phased in the third generation, and ultimately attributed to the first-generation germlines in which they arose. Because germline mutations accumulate with age, we hypothesized that they may limit the duration of childbearing in women, and if accompanied by accumulation of mutations in somatic tissues, reflect aging rates generally in both sexes. Here we test whether germ cell mutations present in a Generation I cohort when they were young adults predict two clinically important outcomes in those same individuals: survival in both sexes, and age-related fertility decline in women. We also explore a possible linkage between the timing of puberty and the establishment of adult germline mutation accumulation rates. METHODS Germline mutation counts in 122 Generation I individuals (61 women, 61 men) from 41 three-generation Utah families were converted to germline mutation rates by normalizing each subject's number of mutations to the callable fraction of their genome. Age at death, cause of death, cancer incidence, and reproductive histories were provided by the Utah Population Database, Utah Cancer Registry, and Utah Genetic Reference Project. Fertility analyses were restricted to the 53 women whose age at last birth (ALB) was at least 30 years, the approximate age when the decline in female fertility ending with menopause begins. The age when adult germline mutation accumulation rates are established was estimated by regression analyses of the Generation I data. Self-reported age at menarche was available for 20 of the Generation I women. RESULTS After adjusting for birth year, sex, and parental age effects in Cox proportional hazard regression models, a one standard deviation increase in the germline mutation rates present in the Generation I cohort when they were young adults predicted significantly higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.97; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.12-3.46; p=0.019) in those same individuals. The median survival advantage for subjects with mutation rates {\textless} 25th percentile vs. those with mutation rates {\textgreater} 75th percentile was approximately 8 years for women and 13 years for men. Among women with ALB ≥ 30 years, those in the top 50{\%} of germline mutation rates had significantly fewer live births than those in the bottom 25{\%} (p=0.026), and higher mutation rates were significantly associated (p=0.036) with a younger ALB ({\textless}25th percentile, 34.8 years). Linear regression analyses indicate that the germline mutation accumulation rates of adulthood are established no earlier than middle to late childhood. We therefore investigated the hypothesis that puberty induces mutation accumulation after a prepubertal phase when mutation burdens are plateaued. As predicted, among Generation I women, those reporting older ages at menarche had significantly lower germline mutation rates. Furthermore, Generation II parental couples with similar germline mutation accumulation rates (mainly reflecting mutations accumulating in fathers) varied about five years in the paternal age at which they acquired the same number of mutations, as would be expected if puberty, which also has a range of onset of approximately 5 years, causes a resumption of mutation accumulation after a plateaued prepubertal phase. CONCLUSIONS Germline mutation accumulation rates in healthy young adults may provide a measure of both reproductive and systemic aging. The data further suggest that mutation accumulation rates are established around puberty, just when DNA repair genes' expression levels are known to begin their lifelong decline.

abstract = {N(6)-Methyladenosine (m(6)A) is a modified base present in the mRNA of all higher eukaryotes and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where there is an increase in m(6)A levels during sporulation. The methyltransferase, Ime4, is responsible for this modification and has a role in the initiation of meiosis. However, neither the function, nor the extent of distribution of this nucleotide modification is established. We demonstrate that in S. cerevisiae, substantial levels of internal adenosine methylation are present in the GpA context in mRNA from sporulating cells, which is consistent with the preferred methylation consensus of higher eukaryotes. Based upon our quantification data, every second transcript could contain one m(6)A during meiosis. As methylation is distributed across all mRNA size ranges, it is likely that m(6)A is not limited to a small population of messages. We developed a new antibody based method for identifying m(6)A containing messages, and using this method the transcripts of three key, early regulators of meiosis, IME1, IME2 and IME4 itself, were identified as being methylated. The position of m(6)A in IME2 was narrowed down to a region in the 3'-end. Methylation of these and other targets suggests mechanisms by which IME4 could control developmental choices leading to meiosis.},

abstract = {Besides translation, transfer RNAs (tRNAs) play many non-canonical roles in various biological pathways and exhibit highly variable expression profiles. To unravel the emerging complexities of tRNA biology and molecular mechanisms underlying them, an efficient tRNA sequencing method is required. However, the rigid structure of tRNA has been presenting a challenge to the development of such methods. We report the development of Y-shaped Adapter-ligated MAture TRNA sequencing (YAMAT-seq), an efficient and convenient method for high-throughput sequencing of mature tRNAs. YAMAT-seq circumvents the issue of inefficient adapter ligation, a characteristic of conventional RNA sequencing methods for mature tRNAs, by employing the efficient and specific ligation of Y-shaped adapter to mature tRNAs using T4 RNA Ligase 2. Subsequent cDNA amplification and next-generation sequencing successfully yield numerous mature tRNA sequences. YAMAT-seq has high specificity for mature tRNAs and high sensitivity to detect most isoacceptors from minute amount of total RNA. Moreover, YAMAT-seq shows quantitative capability to estimate expression levels of mature tRNAs, and has high reproducibility and broad applicability for various cell lines. YAMAT-seq thus provides high-throughput technique for identifying tRNA profiles and their regulations in various transcriptomes, which could play important regulatory roles in translation and other biological processes.},

abstract = {Cancer cells exhibit multiple epigenetic changes with prominent local DNA hypermethylation and widespread hypomethylation affecting large chromosomal domains. Epigenome studies often disregard the study of repeat elements owing to technical complexity and their undefined role in genome regulation. We have developed NSUMA (Next-generation Sequencing of UnMethylated Alu), a cost-effective approach allowing the unambiguous interrogation of DNA methylation in more than 130,000 individual Alu elements, the most abundant retrotransposon in the human genome. DNA methylation profiles of Alu repeats have been analyzed in colon cancers and normal tissues using NSUMA and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. Normal cells show a low proportion of unmethylated Alu (1{\%}-4{\%}) that may increase up to 10-fold in cancer cells. In normal cells, unmethylated Alu elements tend to locate in the vicinity of functionally rich regions and display epigenetic features consistent with a direct impact on genome regulation. In cancer cells, Alu repeats are more resistant to hypomethylation than other retroelements. Genome segmentation based on high/low rates of Alu hypomethylation allows the identification of genomic compartments with differential genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic features. Alu hypomethylated regions show low transcriptional activity, late DNA replication, and its extent is associated with higher chromosomal instability. Our analysis demonstrates that Alu retroelements contribute to define the epigenetic landscape of normal and cancer cells and provides a unique resource on the epigenetic dynamics of a principal, but largely unexplored, component of the primate genome.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND In recent years the Illumina HumanMethylation450 (HM450) BeadChip has provided a user-friendly platform to profile DNA methylation in human samples. However, HM450 lacked coverage of distal regulatory elements. Illumina have now released the MethylationEPIC (EPIC) BeadChip, with new content specifically designed to target these regions. We have used HM450 and whole-genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS) to perform a critical evaluation of the new EPIC array platform. RESULTS EPIC covers over 850,000 CpG sites, including {\textgreater}90 {\%} of the CpGs from the HM450 and an additional 413,743 CpGs. Even though the additional probes improve the coverage of regulatory elements, including 58 {\%} of FANTOM5 enhancers, only 7 {\%} distal and 27 {\%} proximal ENCODE regulatory elements are represented. Detailed comparisons of regulatory elements from EPIC and WGBS show that a single EPIC probe is not always informative for those distal regulatory elements showing variable methylation across the region. However, overall data from the EPIC array at single loci are highly reproducible across technical and biological replicates and demonstrate high correlation with HM450 and WGBS data. We show that the HM450 and EPIC arrays distinguish differentially methylated probes, but the absolute agreement depends on the threshold set for each platform. Finally, we provide an annotated list of probes whose signal could be affected by cross-hybridisation or underlying genetic variation. CONCLUSION The EPIC array is a significant improvement over the HM450 array, with increased genome coverage of regulatory regions and high reproducibility and reliability, providing a valuable tool for high-throughput human methylome analyses from diverse clinical samples.},

The associated posttranslational modifications regulate essential chromatin-dependent processes, yet whether each histone copy is identically modified in vivo is unclear. We demonstrate that nucleosomes in embryonic stem cells, fibroblasts, and cancer cells exist in both symmetrically and asymmetrically modified populations for histone H3 lysine 27 di/trimethylation (H3K27me2/3) and H4K20me1. Further, we obtained direct physical evidence for bivalent nucleosomes carrying H3K4me3 or H3K36me3 along with H3K27me3, albeit on opposite H3 tails. Bivalency at target genes was resolved upon differentiation of ES cells. Polycomb repressive complex 2-mediated methylation of H3K27 was inhibited when nucleosomes contain symmetrically, but not asymmetrically, placed H3K4me3 or H3K36me3. These findings uncover a potential mechanism for the incorporation of bivalent features into nucleosomes and demonstrate how asymmetry might set the stage to diversify functional nucleosome states.},

abstract = {The majority of CpG dinucleotides in the human genome are methylated at cytosine bases. However, active gene regulatory elements are generally hypomethylated relative to their flanking regions, and the binding of some transcription factors (TFs) is diminished by methylation of their target sequences. By analysis of 542 human TFs with methylation-sensitive SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment), we found that there are also many TFs that prefer CpG-methylated sequences. Most of these are in the extended homeodomain family. Structural analysis showed that homeodomain specificity for methylcytosine depends on direct hydrophobic interactions with the methylcytosine 5-methyl group. This study provides a systematic examination of the effect of an epigenetic DNA modification on human TF binding specificity and reveals that many developmentally important proteins display preference for mCpG-containing sequences.},

Quantitative measures are of special importance for DNA methylation analysis in various developmental and pathological situations. Analysis of DNA methylation patterns by pyrosequencing combines a simple reaction protocol with reproducible and accurate measures of the degree of methylation at several CpGs in close proximity with high quantitative resolution. After bisulfite treatment and PCR, the degree of each methylation at each CpG position in a sequence is determined from the ratio of T and C. The process of purification and sequencing can be repeated for the same template to analyze other CpGs in the same amplification product. Quantitative epigenotypes are obtained using this protocol in approximately 4 h for up to 96 DNA samples when bisulfite-treated DNA is already available as the starting material.},

abstract = {How easy is it to reproduce the results found in a typical computational biology paper? Either through experience or intuition the reader will already know that the answer is with difficulty or not at all. In this paper we attempt to quantify this difficulty by reproducing a previously published paper for different classes of users (ranging from users with little expertise to domain experts) and suggest ways in which the situation might be improved. Quantification is achieved by estimating the time required to reproduce each of the steps in the method described in the original paper and make them part of an explicit workflow that reproduces the original results. Reproducing the method took several months of effort, and required using new versions and new software that posed challenges to reconstructing and validating the results. The quantification leads to "reproducibility maps" that reveal that novice researchers would only be able to reproduce a few of the steps in the method, and that only expert researchers with advance knowledge of the domain would be able to reproduce the method in its entirety. The workflow itself is published as an online resource together with supporting software and data. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the complexities of requiring reproducibility in terms of cost versus benefit, and a desiderata with our observations and guidelines for improving reproducibility. This has implications not only in reproducing the work of others from published papers, but reproducing work from one's own laboratory. {\textcopyright} 2013 Garijo et al.},

abstract = {Epigenetic clocks are mathematical models that predict the biological age of an individual using DNA methylation data, and which have emerged in the last few years as the most accurate biomarkers of the ageing process. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that control the rate of such clocks. Here, we have examined the human epigenetic clock in patients with a variety of developmental disorders, harbouring mutations in proteins of the epigenetic machinery. Using the Horvath epigenetic clock, we performed an unbiased screen for epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) in the blood of these patients. We demonstrate that loss-of-function mutations in the H3K36 histone methyltransferase NSD1, which cause Sotos syndrome, substantially accelerate epigenetic ageing. Furthermore, we show that the normal ageing process and Sotos syndrome share methylation changes and the genomic context in which they occur. Finally, we found that the Horvath clock CpG sites are characterised by a higher Shannon methylation entropy when compared with the rest of the genome, which is dramatically decreased in Sotos syndrome patients. These results suggest that the H3K36 methylation machinery is a key component of the epigenetic maintenance system in humans, which controls the rate of epigenetic ageing, and this role seems to be conserved in model organisms. Our observations provide novel insights into the mechanisms behind the epigenetic ageing clock and we expect will shed light on the different processes that erode the human epigenetic landscape during ageing.},

The three-dimensional structures of the intact lac repressor, the lac repressor bound to the gratuitous inducer isopropyl-beta-D-1-thiogalactoside (IPTG) and the lac repressor complexed with a 21-base pair symmetric operator DNA have been determined. These three structures show the conformation of the molecule in both the induced and repressed states and provide a framework for understanding a wealth of biochemical and genetic information. The DNA sequence of the lac operon has three lac repressor recognition sites in a stretch of 500 base pairs. The crystallographic structure of the complex with DNA suggests that the tetrameric repressor functions synergistically with catabolite gene activator protein (CAP) and participates in the quaternary formation of repression loops in which one tetrameric repressor interacts simultaneously with two sites on the genomic DNA.},

abstract = {The 5' region of the gene encoding human X chromosome-linked phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) is a promoter-containing CpG island known to be methylated at 119 of 121 CpG dinucleotides in a 450-base-pair region on the inactive human X chromosome in the hamster-human cell line X8-6T2. Here we report the use of polymerase chain reaction-aided genomic sequencing to determine the complete methylation pattern of this region in clones derived from X8-6T2 cells after treatment with the methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine. We find (i) a clone showing full expression of human phosphoglycerate kinase is fully unmethylated in this region; (ii) clones not expressing human phosphoglycerate kinase remain methylated at approximately 50{\%} of CpG sites, with a pattern of interspersed methylated (M) and unmethylated (U) sites different for each clone; (iii) singles, defined as M-U-M or U-M-U, are common; and (iv) a few CpG sites are partially methylated. The data are interpreted according to a model of multiple, autonomous CpG sites, and estimates are made for two key parameters, maintenance efficiency (Em approximately 99.9{\%} per site per generation) and de novo methylation efficiency (Ed approximately 5{\%}). These parameter values and the hypothesis that several independent sites must be unmethylated for transcription can explain the stable maintenance of X chromosome inactivation. We also consider how the active region is kept free of methylation and suggest that transcription inhibits methylation by decreasing Em so that methylation cannot be maintained. Thus, multiple CpG sites, independent with respect to a dynamic methylation system, can stabilize two alternative states of methylation and transcription.},

abstract = {Autophagy is involved with the turnover of intracellular components and the management of stress responses. Genetic studies in mice have shown that suppression of neuronal autophagy can lead to the accumulation of protein aggregates and neurodegeneration. However, no study has shown that increasing autophagic gene expression can be beneficial to an aging nervous system. Here we demonstrate that expression of several autophagy genes is reduced in Drosophila neural tissues as a normal part of aging. The age-dependent suppression of autophagy occurs concomitantly with the accumulation of insoluble ubiquitinated proteins (IUP), a marker of neuronal aging and degeneration. Mutations in the Atg8a gene (autophagy-related 8a) result in reduced lifespan, IUP accumulation and increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. In contrast, enhanced Atg8a expression in older fly brains extends the average adult lifespan by 56{\%} and promotes resistance to oxidative stress and the accumulation of ubiquitinated and oxidized proteins. These data indicate that genetic or age-dependent suppression of autophagy is closely associated with the buildup of cellular damage in neurons and a reduced lifespan, while maintaining the expression of a rate-limiting autophagy gene prevents the age-dependent accumulation of damage in neurons and promotes longevity.},

abstract = {Background: The well-established association of chronological age with changes in DNA methylation is primarily founded on the analysis of large sets of blood samples, while conclusions regarding tissue-specificity are typically based on small number of samples, tissues and CpGs. Here, we systematically investigate the tissue-specific character of age-related DNA methylation changes at the level of the CpG, functional genomic region and nearest gene in a large dataset. Results: We assembled a compendium of public data, encompassing genome-wide DNA methylation data (Illumina 450k array) on 8092 samples from 16 different tissues, including 7 tissues with moderate to high sample numbers (Dataset size range 96-1202, N total = 2858). In the 7 tissues (brain, buccal, liver, kidney, subcutaneous fat, monocytes and T-helper cells), we identified 7850 differentially methylated positions that gained (gain-aDMPs; cut-offs: P bonf ≤ 0.05, effect size ≥ 2{\%}/10 years) and 4,287 that lost DNA methylation with age (loss-aDMPs), 92{\%} of which had not previously been reported for whole blood. The majority of all aDMPs identified occurred in one tissue only (gain-aDMPs: 85.2{\%}; loss-aDMPs: 97.4{\%}), an effect independent of statistical power. This striking tissue-specificity extended to both the functional genomic regions (defined by chromatin state segmentation) and the nearest gene. However, aDMPs did accumulate in regions with the same functional annotation across tissues, namely polycomb-repressed CpG islands for gain-aDMPs and regions marked by active histone modifications for loss-aDMPs. Conclusion: Our analysis shows that age-related DNA methylation changes are highly tissue-specific. These results may guide the development of improved tissue-specific markers of chronological and, perhaps, biological age.},

abstract = {'Epigenetic age acceleration' is a valuable biomarker of ageing, predictive of morbidity and mortality, but for which the underlying biological mechanisms are not well established. Two commonly used measures, derived from DNA methylation, are Horvath-based (Horvath-EAA) and Hannum-based (Hannum-EAA) epigenetic age acceleration. We conducted genome-wide association studies of Horvath-EAA and Hannum-EAA in 13,493 unrelated individuals of European ancestry, to elucidate genetic determinants of differential epigenetic ageing. We identified ten independent SNPs associated with Horvath-EAA, five of which are novel. We also report 21 Horvath-EAA-associated genes including several involved in metabolism (NHLRC, TPMT) and immune system pathways (TRIM59, EDARADD). GWAS of Hannum-EAA identified one associated variant (rs1005277), and implicated 12 genes including several involved in innate immune system pathways (UBE2D3, MANBA, TRIM46), with metabolic functions (UBE2D3, MANBA), or linked to lifespan regulation (CISD2). Both measures had nominal inverse genetic correlations with father's age at death, a rough proxy for lifespan. Nominally significant genetic correlations between Hannum-EAA and lifestyle factors including smoking behaviours and education support the hypothesis that Hannum-based epigenetic ageing is sensitive to variations in environment, whereas Horvath-EAA is a more stable cellular ageing process. We identified novel SNPs and genes associated with epigenetic age acceleration, and highlighted differences in the genetic architecture of Horvath-based and Hannum-based epigenetic ageing measures. Understanding the biological mechanisms underlying individual differences in the rate of epigenetic ageing could help explain different trajectories of age-related decline.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The incidence of hematologic cancers increases with age. These cancers are associated with recurrent somatic mutations in specific genes. We hypothesized that such mutations would be detectable in the blood of some persons who are not known to have hematologic disorders. METHODS We analyzed whole-exome sequencing data from DNA in the peripheral-blood cells of 17,182 persons who were unselected for hematologic phenotypes. We looked for somatic mutations by identifying previously characterized single-nucleotide variants and small insertions or deletions in 160 genes that are recurrently mutated in hematologic cancers. The presence of mutations was analyzed for an association with hematologic phenotypes, survival, and cardiovascular events. RESULTS Detectable somatic mutations were rare in persons younger than 40 years of age but rose appreciably in frequency with age. Among persons 70 to 79 years of age, 80 to 89 years of age, and 90 to 108 years of age, these clonal mutations were observed in 9.5{\%} (219 of 2300 persons), 11.7{\%} (37 of 317), and 18.4{\%} (19 of 103), respectively. The majority of the variants occurred in three genes: DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1. The presence of a somatic mutation was associated with an increase in the risk of hematologic cancer (hazard ratio, 11.1; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 3.9 to 32.6), an increase in all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.4; 95{\%} CI, 1.1 to 1.8), and increases in the risks of incident coronary heart disease (hazard ratio, 2.0; 95{\%} CI, 1.2 to 3.4) and ischemic stroke (hazard ratio, 2.6; 95{\%} CI, 1.4 to 4.8). CONCLUSIONS Age-related clonal hematopoiesis is a common condition that is associated with increases in the risk of hematologic cancer and in all-cause mortality, with the latter possibly due to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

BglII restriction fragments were size-selected to 500-600 bp, equipped with adapters, treated with bisulfite, PCR amplified, cloned and sequenced. We constructed RRBS libraries from murine ES cells and from ES cells lacking DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and 3b and with knocked-down (kd) levels of Dnmt1 (Dnmt[1(kd),3a-/-,3b-/-]). Sequencing of 960 RRBS clones from Dnmt[1(kd),3a-/-,3b-/-] cells generated 343 kb of non-redundant bisulfite sequence covering 66212 cytosines in the genome. All but 38 cytosines had been converted to uracil indicating a conversion rate of {\textgreater}99.9{\%}. Of the remaining cytosines 35 were found in CpG and 3 in CpT dinucleotides. Non-CpG methylation was {\textgreater}250-fold reduced compared with wild-type ES cells, consistent with a role for Dnmt3a and/or Dnmt3b in CpA and CpT methylation. Closer inspection revealed neither a consensus sequence around the methylated sites nor evidence for clustering of residual methylation in the genome. Our findings indicate random loss rather than specific maintenance of methylation in Dnmt[1(kd),3a-/-,3b-/-] cells. Near-complete bisulfite conversion and largely unbiased representation of RRBS libraries suggest that random shotgun bisulfite sequencing can be scaled to a genome-wide approach.},

abstract = {The most common neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins. Tauopathies, which include Alzheimer disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, Pick disease and cases of frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17, are characterized by the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated and filamentous MAPT/tau protein. The pathological mechanisms involved in MAPT protein accumulation are not well understood, but a possible impairment of protein degradation pathways has been suggested. We investigated the effects of autophagy stimulation on MAPT pathology in a model tauopathy, the human mutant P301S MAPT transgenic mouse line. In the brain of the trehalose-treated mutant mice, autophagy is activated and a reduced number of neurons containing MAPT inclusions, as well as a decreased amount of insoluble MAPT, are observed. The improvement of MAPT pathology is associated with increased nerve cell survival. Moreover, MAPT inclusions colocalize with SQSTM1/p62- and LC3-positive puncta, suggesting the colocalization of MAPT aggregates with autophagic vacuoles. Autophagy is not activated in the spinal cord of the human P301S MAPT transgenic mice and neuronal survival, as well as MAPT pathology, is unaffected. This study supports a role for autophagy stimulation in the degradation of MAPT aggregates and opens new perspectives for the investigation of autophagy as a pathological mechanism involved in neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {Despite growing interest in Open Access (OA) to scholarly literature, there is an unmet need for large-scale, up-to-date, and reproducible studies assessing the prevalence and characteristics of OA. We address this need using oaDOI, an open online service that determines OA status for 67 million articles. We use three samples, each of 100,000 articles, to investigateOAin three populations: (1) all journal articles assigned a Crossref DOI, (2) recent journal articles indexed in Web of Science, and (3) articles viewed by users of Unpaywall, an open-source browser extension that lets users find OA articles using oaDOI. We estimate that at least 28{\%} of the scholarly literature is OA (19M in total) and that this proportion is growing, driven particularly by growth in Gold and Hybrid. The most recent year analyzed (2015) also has the highest percentage of OA (45{\%}). Because of this growth, and the fact that readers disproportionately access newer articles, we find that Unpaywall users encounter OA quite frequently: 47{\%} of articles they view are OA. Notably, the most common mechanism for OA is not Gold, Green, or Hybrid OA, but rather an under-discussed category we dub Bronze: articles made freeto- read on the publisher website, without an explicit Open license. We also examine the citation impact of OA articles, corroborating the so-called open-access citation advantage: accounting for age and discipline, OA articles receive 18{\%} more citations than average, an effect driven primarily by Green and Hybrid OA. Weencourage further research using the free oaDOI service, as a way to inform OA policy and practice.},

abstract = {Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular bacteria, developing inside host cells within chlamydial inclusions. From these inclusions, the chlamydiae secrete proteins into the host cell cytoplasm. A pathway through which secreted proteins can be delivered is the type III secretion system (T3SS). The T3SS is common to several gram-negative bacteria and the secreted proteins serve a variety of functions often related to the modulation of host signalling. To identify new potentially secreted proteins, the cytoplasm was extracted from Chlamydia trachomatis L2-infected HeLa cells, and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profiles of [(35)S]-labelled chlamydial proteins from this extract were compared with profiles of chlamydial proteins from the lysate of infected cells. In this way, CT621 was identified. CT621 is a member of a family of proteins containing a domain of unknown function DUF582 that is only found within the genus Chlamydia. Immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting demonstrated that CT621 is secreted late in the chlamydial developmental cycle and that it is the first chlamydial protein found to be localized within both the host cell cytoplasm and the nucleus. To determine whether CT621 is secreted through the T3SS, an inhibitor of this apparatus was added to the infection medium, resulting in retention of the protein inside the chlamydiae. Hence, the so far uncharacterized CT621 is a new type III secretion effector protein.},

abstract = {The extremely large number of leaves produced by terrestrial and aquatic plants provide habitats for colonization by a diversity of microorganisms. This review focuses on the bacterial component of leaf microbial communities, with emphasis on Pseudomonas syringae-a species that participates in leaf ecosystems as a pathogen, ice nucleus, and epiphyte. Among the diversity of bacteria that colonize leaves, none has received wider attention than P. syringae, as it gained notoriety for being the first recombinant organism (Ice(-) P. syringae) to be deliberately introduced into the environment. We focus on P. syringae to illustrate the attractiveness and somewhat unique opportunities provided by leaf ecosystems for addressing fundamental questions of microbial population dynamics and mechanisms of plant-bacterium interactions. Leaf ecosystems are dynamic and ephemeral. The physical environment surrounding phyllosphere microbes changes continuously with daily cycles in temperature, radiation, relative humidity, wind velocity, and leaf wetness. Slightly longer-term changes occur as weather systems pass. Seasonal climatic changes impose still a longer cycle. The physical and physiological characteristics of leaves change as they expand, mature, and senesce and as host phenology changes. Many of these factors influence the development of populations of P. syringae upon populations of leaves. P. syringae was first studied for its ability to cause disease on plants. However, disease causation is but one aspect of its life strategy. The bacterium can be found in association with healthy leaves, growing and surviving for many generations on the surfaces of leaves as an epiphyte. A number of genes and traits have been identified that contribute to the fitness of P. syringae in the phyllosphere. While still in their infancy, such research efforts demonstrate that the P. syringae-leaf ecosystem is a particularly attractive system with which to bridge the gap between what is known about the molecular biology of genes linked to pathogenicity and the ecology and epidemiology of associated diseases as they occur in natural settings, the field.},

FTO is a 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent N-methyl nucleic acid demethylase that acts on substrates including 3-methylthymidine, 3-methyluracil, and 6-methyladenine. To identify FTO inhibitors, we screened a set of 2OG analogues and related compounds using differential scanning fluorometry- and liquid chromatography-based assays. The results revealed sets of both cyclic and acyclic 2OG analogues that are FTO inhibitors. Identified inhibitors include small molecules that have been used in clinical studies for the inhibition of other 2OG oxygenases. Crystallographic analyses reveal inhibition by 2OG cosubstrate or primary substrate competitors as well as compounds that bind across both cosubstrate and primary substrate binding sites. The results will aid the development of more potent and selective FTO inhibitors.},

abstract = {A major challenge faced by epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) is cell-type heterogeneity. As many EWAS have already demonstrated, adjusting for changes in cell-type composition can be critical when analyzing and interpreting findings from such studies. Because of their importance, a great number of different statistical algorithms, which adjust for cell-type composition, have been proposed. Some of the methods are 'reference based' in that they require a priori defined reference DNA methylation profiles of cell types that are present in the tissue of interest, while other algorithms are 'reference free.' At present, however, it is unclear how best to adjust for cell-type heterogeneity, as this may also largely depend on the type of tissue and phenotype being considered. Here, we provide a critical review of the major existing algorithms for correcting cell-type composition in the context of Illumina Infinium Methylation Beadarrays, with the aim of providing useful recommendations to the EWAS community.},

abstract = {DNA methylation is often analyzed by reporting the average methylation degree of each cytosine. In this study, we used a single molecule methylation analysis in order to look at the methylation conformation of individual molecules. Using D-aspartate oxidase as a model gene, we performed an in-depth methylation analysis through the developmental stages of 3 different mouse tissues (brain, lung, and gut), where this gene undergoes opposite methylation destiny. This approach allowed us to track both methylation and demethylation processes at high resolution. The complexity of these dynamics was markedly simplified by introducing the concept of methylation classes (MCs), defined as the number of methylated cytosines per molecule, irrespective of their position. The MC concept smooths the stochasticity of the system, allowing a more deterministic description. In this framework, we also propose a mathematical model based on the Markov chain. This model aims to identify the transition probability of a molecule from one MC to another during methylation and demethylation processes. The results of our model suggest that: 1) both processes are ruled by a dominant class of phenomena, namely, the gain or loss of one methyl group at a time; and 2) the probability of a single CpG site becoming methylated or demethylated depends on the methylation status of the whole molecule at that time.},

The function of the TCR proteins CSB, CSA and UVSSA and the manner in which the core DNA repair complex, including transcription factor IIH (TFIIH), is recruited are largely unknown. Here, we define the assembly mechanism of the TCR complex in human isogenic knockout cells. We show that TCR is initiated by RNAPIIo-bound CSB, which recruits CSA through a newly identified CSA-interaction motif (CIM). Once recruited, CSA facilitates the association of UVSSA with stalled RNAPIIo. Importantly, we find that UVSSA is the key factor that recruits the TFIIH complex in a manner that is stimulated by CSB and CSA. Together these findings identify a sequential and highly cooperative assembly mechanism of TCR proteins and reveal the mechanism for TFIIH recruitment to DNA damage-stalled RNAPIIo to initiate repair.},

abstract = {Bacterial cells possess multiple cytoskeletal proteins involved in a wide range of cellular processes. These cytoskeletal proteins are dynamic, but the driving forces and cellular functions of these dynamics remain poorly understood. Eukaryotic cytoskeletal dynamics are often driven by motor proteins, but in bacteria no motors that drive cytoskeletal motion have been identified to date. Here, we quantitatively study the dynamics of the Escherichia coli actin homolog MreB, which is essential for the maintenance of rod-like cell shape in bacteria. We find that MreB rotates around the long axis of the cell in a persistent manner. Whereas previous studies have suggested that MreB dynamics are driven by its own polymerization, we show that MreB rotation does not depend on its own polymerization but rather requires the assembly of the peptidoglycan cell wall. The cell-wall synthesis machinery thus either constitutes a novel type of extracellular motor that exerts force on cytoplasmic MreB, or is indirectly required for an as-yet-unidentified motor. Biophysical simulations suggest that one function of MreB rotation is to ensure a uniform distribution of new peptidoglycan insertion sites, a necessary condition to maintain rod shape during growth. These findings both broaden the view of cytoskeletal motors and deepen our understanding of the physical basis of bacterial morphogenesis.},

Here, we describe a family of proteins in yeast (ARTs, for arrestin-related trafficking adaptors) that function by targeting specific PM proteins to the endocytic system. Two members (Art1 and Art2) of the family were discovered in chemical-genetic screens, and they direct downregulation of distinct amino acid transporters triggered by specific stimuli. Sequence analysis revealed a total of nine ART family members in yeast. In addition to similarity to arrestins, the ARTs each contain multiple PY motifs. These motifs are required for recruitment of the Rsp5/Nedd4-like ubiquitin ligase, which modifies the cargoes as well as the ARTs. As a result, ubiquitinated cargoes are internalized and targeted to the vacuole (lysosome) for degradation. We propose that ARTs provide a cargo-specific quality-control pathway that mediates endocytic downregulation by coupling Rsp5/Nedd4 to diverse plasma membrane proteins.},

According to several reports 5-hydroxymethyl-cytosine distribution is tissue-specific in mammals. Thus, 5-hmC is enriched in embryonic cell populations and in adult neuronal tissue. Here, we describe a novel method of semi-quantitative immunohistochemical detection of 5-hmC and utilize it to assess the levels of this modification in amphibian tissues. We show that, similar to mammalian embryos, 5-hmC is enriched in axolotl tadpoles compared with adult tissues. Our data demonstrate that 5-hmC distribution is tissue-specific in amphibians, and that strong 5-hmC enrichment in neuronal cells is conserved between amphibians and mammals. In addition, we identify 5-hmC-enriched cell populations that are distributed in amphibian skin and connective tissue in a mosaic manner. Our results illustrate that immunochemistry can be successfully used not only for spatial identification of cells enriched with 5-hmC, but also for the semi-quantitative assessment of the levels of this epigenetic modification in single cells of different tissues.},

Our results suggest that there are approximately 45,000 CpG islands per haploid genome in humans and 37,000 in the mouse. Sequence comparison confirms that about 20{\%} of the human CpG islands are absent from the homologous mouse genes. Analysis of a selection of genes suggests that both human and mouse are losing CpG islands over evolutionary time due to de novo methylation in the germ line followed by CpG loss through mutation. This process appears to be more rapid in rodents. Combining the number of CpG islands with the proportion of island-associated genes, we estimate that the total number of genes per haploid genome is approximately 80,000 in both organisms.},

abstract = {Semi-automated genome annotation methods such as Segway enable understanding of chromatin activity. Here we present chromatin state annotations of 164 human cell types using 1,615 genomics data sets. To produce these annotations, we developed a fully-automated annotation strategy in which we train separate unsupervised annotation models on each cell type and use a machine learning classifier to automate the state interpretation step. Using these annotations, we developed a measure of the functional importance of each genomic position called the "functionality score", which allows us to aggregate information across cell types into a multi-cell type view. This score provides a measure of importance directly attributable to a specific activity in a specific set of cell types. In contrast to evolutionary conservation, this measure is not biased to detect only elements shared with related species. Using the functionality score, we combined all our annotations into a single cell type-agnostic encyclopedia that catalogs all human functional regulatory elements, enabling easy and intuitive interpretation of the effect of genome variants on phenotype, such as in disease-associated, evolutionary conserved or positively selected loci. These resources, including cell type-specific annotations, encyclopedia and a visualization server, are publicly available online at http://noble.gs.washington.edu/proj/encyclopedia/.},

abstract = {Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are a central component for the biological synthesis of proteins, and they are among the most highly conserved and frequently transcribed genes in all living things. Despite their clear significance for fundamental cellular processes, the forces governing tRNA evolution are poorly understood. We present evidence that transcription-associated mutagenesis and strong purifying selection are key determinants of patterns of sequence variation within and surrounding tRNA genes in humans and diverse model organisms. Remarkably, the mutation rate at broadly expressed cytosolic tRNA loci is likely between 7 and 10 times greater than the nuclear genome average. Furthermore, evolutionary analyses provide strong evidence that tRNA genes, but not their flanking sequences, experience strong purifying selection acting against this elevated mutation rate. We also find a strong correlation between tRNA expression levels and the mutation rates in their immediate flanking regions, suggesting a simple method for estimating individual tRNA gene activity. Collectively, this study illuminates the extreme competing forces in tRNA gene evolution and indicates that mutations at tRNA loci contribute disproportionately to mutational load and have unexplored fitness consequences in human populations.},

abstract = {The primary task of developing embryos is genome replication, yet how DNA replication is integrated with the profound cellular changes that occur through development is largely unknown. Using an approach to map DNA replication at high resolution in C. elegans, we show that replication origins are marked with specific histone modifications that define gene enhancers. We demonstrate that the level of enhancer associated modifications scale with the efficiency at which the origin is utilized. By mapping replication origins at different developmental stages, we show that the positions and activity of origins is largely invariant through embryogenesis. Contrary to expectation, we find that replication origins are specified prior to the broad onset of zygotic transcription, yet when transcription initiates it does so in close proximity to the pre-defined replication origins. Transcription and DNA replication origins are correlated, but the association breaks down when embryonic cell division ceases. Collectively, our data indicate that replication origins are fundamental organizers and regulators of gene activity through embryonic development.},

abstract = {Remodeling DNA methylation in mammalian genomes can be global, as seen in preimplantation embryos and primordial germ cells (PGCs), or locus specific, which can regulate neighboring gene expression. In PGCs, global and locus-specific DNA demethylation occur in sequential stages, with an initial global decrease in methylated cytosines (stage I) followed by a Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase (Tet)-dependent decrease in methylated cytosines that act at imprinting control regions (ICRs) and meiotic genes (stage II). The purpose of the two-stage mechanism is unclear. Here we show that Dnmt1 preserves DNA methylation through stage I at ICRs and meiotic gene promoters and is required for the pericentromeric enrichment of 5hmC. We discovered that the functional consequence of abrogating two-stage DNA demethylation in PGCs was precocious germline differentiation leading to hypogonadism and infertility. Therefore, bypassing stage-specific DNA demethylation has significant consequences for progenitor germ cell differentiation and the ability to transmit DNA from parent to offspring.},

abstract = {Sepiapterin reductase catalyses the last steps in the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin, the essential co-factor of aromatic amino acid hydroxylases and nitric oxide synthases. We have determined the crystal structure of mouse sepiapterin reductase by multiple isomorphous replacement at a resolution of 1.25 A in its ternary complex with oxaloacetate and NADP. The homodimeric structure reveals a single-domain alpha/beta-fold with a central four-helix bundle connecting two seven-stranded parallel beta-sheets, each sandwiched between two arrays of three helices. Ternary complexes with the substrate sepiapterin or the product tetrahydrobiopterin were studied. Each subunit contains a specific aspartate anchor (Asp258) for pterin-substrates, which positions the substrate side chain C1'-carbonyl group near Tyr171 OH and NADP C4'N. The catalytic mechanism of SR appears to consist of a NADPH-dependent proton transfer from Tyr171 to the substrate C1' and C2' carbonyl functions accompanied by stereospecific side chain isomerization. Complex structures with the inhibitor N-acetyl serotonin show the indoleamine bound such that both reductase and isomerase activity for pterins is inhibited, but reaction with a variety of carbonyl compounds is possible. The complex structure with N-acetyl serotonin suggests the possibility for a highly specific feedback regulatory mechanism between the formation of indoleamines and pteridines in vivo.},

abstract = {Plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases (PMCAs) are a ubiquitous system for the expulsion of Ca2+ from eukaryotic cells. In tight monolayers of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells representing a distal kidney tubule model, PMCAs are responsible for about one-third of the vectorial Ca2+ transport under resting conditions, with the remainder being provided by the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. Vitamin D3 (VitD) is known to increase PMCA expression and activity in Ca2+-transporting tissues such as the intestine, as well as in osteoblasts and Madin-Darby bovine kidney epithelial cells. We found that VitD upregulated the expression of the PMCAs (mainly PMCA4b) in MDCK cell lysates at the RNA and protein level in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, VitD caused a decrease of the PMCAs in the apical plasma membrane fraction and a concomitant increase of the pumps in the basolateral membrane. Functional studies demonstrated that transcellular 45Ca2+ flux from the apical-to-basolateral compartment was significantly enhanced by VitD. These findings demonstrate that VitD is a positive regulator of the PMCAs in MDCK epithelial cells. The correlation of decreased apical/increased basolateral expression of the PMCAs with an increase in transcellular Ca2+ flux from the apical (urine) toward the basolateral (blood) compartment indicates the physiological relevance of VitD function in kidney tubular Ca2+ reabsorption.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Genome-wide transcriptional profiling of patient blood samples offers a powerful tool to investigate underlying disease mechanisms and personalized treatment decisions. Most studies are based on analysis of total peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), a mixed population. In this case, accuracy is inherently limited since cell subset-specific differential expression of gene signatures will be diluted by RNA from other cells. While using specific PBMC subsets for transcriptional profiling would improve our ability to extract knowledge from these data, it is rarely obvious which cell subset(s) will be the most informative.RESULTS:We have developed a computational method (Subset Prediction from Enrichment Correlation, SPEC) to predict the cellular source for a pre-defined list of genes (i.e. a gene signature) using only data from total PBMCs. SPEC does not rely on the occurrence of cell subset-specific genes in the signature, but rather takes advantage of correlations with subset-specific genes across a set of samples. Validation using multiple experimental datasets demonstrates that SPEC can accurately identify the source of a gene signature as myeloid or lymphoid, as well as differentiate between B cells, T cells, NK cells and monocytes. Using SPEC, we predict that myeloid cells are the source of the interferon-therapy response gene signature associated with HCV patients who are non-responsive to standard therapy.CONCLUSIONS:SPEC is a powerful technique for blood genomic studies. It can help identify specific cell subsets that are important for understanding disease and therapy response. SPEC is widely applicable since only gene expression profiles from total PBMCs are required, and thus it can easily be used to mine the massive amount of existing microarray or RNA-seq data.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic chromosomes replicate in a temporal order known as the replication-timing program. In mammals, replication timing is cell-type-specific with at least half the genome switching replication timing during development, primarily in units of 400-800 kilobases ('replication domains'), whose positions are preserved in different cell types, conserved between species, and appear to confine long-range effects of chromosome rearrangements. Early and late replication correlate, respectively, with open and closed three-dimensional chromatin compartments identified by high-resolution chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), and, to a lesser extent, late replication correlates with lamina-associated domains (LADs). Recent Hi-C mapping has unveiled substructure within chromatin compartments called topologically associating domains (TADs) that are largely conserved in their positions between cell types and are similar in size to replication domains. However, TADs can be further sub-stratified into smaller domains, challenging the significance of structures at any particular scale. Moreover, attempts to reconcile TADs and LADs to replication-timing data have not revealed a common, underlying domain structure. Here we localize boundaries of replication domains to the early-replicating border of replication-timing transitions and map their positions in 18 human and 13 mouse cell types. We demonstrate that, collectively, replication domain boundaries share a near one-to-one correlation with TAD boundaries, whereas within a cell type, adjacent TADs that replicate at similar times obscure replication domain boundaries, largely accounting for the previously reported lack of alignment. Moreover, cell-type-specific replication timing of TADs partitions the genome into two large-scale sub-nuclear compartments revealing that replication-timing transitions are indistinguishable from late-replicating regions in chromatin composition and lamina association and accounting for the reduced correlation of replication timing to LADs and heterochromatin. Our results reconcile cell-type-specific sub-nuclear compartmentalization and replication timing with developmentally stable structural domains and offer a unified model for large-scale chromosome structure and function.},

abstract = {Background: Chromatin folding gives rise to structural elements among which are clusters of densely interacting DNA regions termed topologically associating domains (TADs). TADs have been characterized across multiple species, tissue types, and differentiation stages, sometimes in association with regulation of biological functions. The reliability and reproducibility of these findings are intrinsically related with the correct identification of these domains from high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments. Results: Here, we test and compare 22 computational methods to identify TADs across 20 different conditions. We find that TAD sizes and numbers vary significantly among callers and data resolutions, challenging the definition of an average TAD size, but strengthening the hypothesis that TADs are hierarchically organized domains, rather than disjoint structural elements. Performances of these methods differ based on data resolution and normalization strategy, but a core set of TAD callers consistently retrieve reproducible domains, even at low sequencing depths, that are enriched for TAD-associated biological features. Conclusions: This study provides a reference for the analysis of chromatin domains from Hi-C experiments and useful guidelines for choosing a suitable approach based on the experimental design, available data, and biological question of interest.},

Using cryo-electron tomography, we demonstrated that B. bacteriovorus cells are capable of substantial flexibility and local deformation of the outer and inner membranes without loss of cell integrity. These shape changes can occur in less than 2 min, and analysis of the internal architecture of highly bent cells showed that the overall distribution of molecular machines and the nucleoid is similar to that in moderately bent cells. B. bacteriovorus cells appear to contain an extensive internal network of short and long filamentous structures. We propose that rearrangements of these structures, in combination with the unique properties of the cell envelope, may underlie the remarkable ability of B. bacteriovorus cells to find and enter bacterial prey.},

abstract = {The unmethylated or methylated status of individual CpG sites is faithfully copied into daughter cells. Here, we analyzed the fidelity in replicating their methylation statuses in cancer cells. A single cell was clonally expanded, and methylation statuses of individual CpG sites were determined for an average of 12.5 DNA molecules obtained from the expanded population. By counting the deviation from the original methylation patterns inferred, the number of errors was measured. The analysis was done in four gastric cancer cell lines for five CpG islands (CGI), and repeated six times (total 1,495 clones sequenced). HSC39 and HSC57 showed error rates {\textless}1.0 x 10(-3) errors per site per generation (99.90-100{\%} fidelity) for all the five CGIs. In contrast, AGS showed significantly elevated error rates, mainly due to increased de novo methylation, in three CGIs (1.6- to 3.2-fold), and KATOIII showed a significantly elevated error rate in one CGI (2.2-fold). By selective amplification of fully methylated DNA molecules by methylation-specific PCR, those were stochastically detected in KATOIII and AGS but never in HSC39 and HSC57. When methylation of entire CGIs was examined for eight additional CGIs, KATOIII and AGS had frequent methylation, whereas HSC39 and HSC57 had few. KATOIII and AGS had four and eight times, respectively, as high expression levels of DNMT3B as HSC39. These data showed that some cancer cells have decreased fidelity in replicating methylation patterns in some CGIs, and that the decrease could lead to methylation of the entire CGIs.},

abstract = {Recent studies have placed transfer RNA (tRNA), a housekeeping molecule, in the heart of fundamental cellular processes such as embryonic development and tumor progression. Such discoveries were contingent on the concomitant development of methods able to de-liver high-quality tRNA profiles. The present study describes the proof of concept obtained in Escherichia coli (E. coli) for an original tRNA analysis platform named SPOt (Streamlined Platform for Observing tRNA). This approach comprises three steps. First, E. coli cultures are spiked with radioactive orthophosphate; second, labeled total RNAs are trizol-extracted; third, RNA samples are hybridized on in-house printed microarrays and spot signals, the proxy for tRNA levels, are quantified by phosphorimaging. Features such as reproducibility and specificity were assessed using several tRNA subpopulations. Dynamic range and sen-sitivity were evaluated by overexpressing specific tRNA species. SPOt does not require any amplification or post-extraction labeling and can be adapted to any organism. It is modular and easily streamlined with popular techniques such as polysome fractionation to profile tRNAs interacting with ribosomes and actively engaged in translation. The biological rele-vance of these data is discussed in regards to codon usage, tRNA gene copy number, and position on the genome.},

abstract = {Cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) is the specific nucleotide regulator of beta-1,4-glucan (cellulose) synthase in Acetobacter xylinum. The enzymes controlling turnover of c-di-GMP are diguanylate cyclase (DGC), which catalyzes its formation, and phosphodiesterase A (PDEA), which catalyzes its degradation. Following biochemical purification of DGC and PDEA, genes encoding isoforms of these enzymes have been isolated and found to be located on three distinct yet highly homologous operons for cyclic diguanylate, cdg1, cdg2, and cdg3. Within each cdg operon, a pdeA gene lies upstream of a dgc gene. cdg1 contains two additional flanking genes, cdg1a and cdg1d. cdg1a encodes a putative transcriptional activator, similar to AadR of Rhodopseudomonas palustris and FixK proteins of rhizobia. The deduced DGC and PDEA proteins have an identical motif structure of two lengthy domains in their C-terminal regions. These domains are also present in numerous bacterial proteins of undefined function. The N termini of the DGC and PDEA deduced proteins contain putative oxygen-sensing domains, based on similarity to domains on bacterial NifL and FixL proteins, respectively. Genetic disruption analyses demonstrated a physiological hierarchy among the cdg operons, such that cdg1 contributes 80{\%} of cellular DGC and PDEA activities and cdg2 and cdg3 contribute 15 and 5{\%}, respectively. Disruption of dgc genes markedly reduced in vivo cellulose production, demonstrating that c-di-GMP controls this process.},

Hence, ameliorating the effects of ageing may prevent multiple diseases simultaneously. Drugs licensed for human use against specific diseases have proved to be effective in extending lifespan and healthspan in animal models, suggesting that there is scope for drug repurposing in humans. New bioinformatic methods to identify and prioritise potential anti-ageing compounds for humans are therefore of interest. In this study, we first used drug-protein interaction information, to rank 1,147 drugs by their likelihood of targeting ageing-related gene products in humans. Among 19 statistically significant drugs, 6 have already been shown to have pro-longevity properties in animal models (p {\textless} 0.001). Using the targets of each drug, we established their association with ageing at multiple levels of biological action including pathways, functions and protein interactions. Finally, combining all the data, we calculated a ranked list of drugs that identified tanespimycin, an inhibitor of HSP-90, as the top-ranked novel anti-ageing candidate. We experimentally validated the pro-longevity effect of tanespimycin through its HSP-90 target in Caenorhabditis elegans.},

FimX, a protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa that governs twitching motility, belongs to a large subfamily containing both GGDEF and EAL domains. Biochemical and structural analyses reveals its function as a high-affinity receptor for c-di-GMP. A model for full-length FimX was generated combining solution scattering data and crystal structures of the degenerate GGDEF and EAL domains. Although FimX forms a dimer in solution via the N-terminal domains, a crystallographic EAL domain dimer suggests modes for the regulation of FimX by c-di-GMP binding. The results provide the structural basis for c-di-GMP sensing via degenerate phosphodiesterases.},

@article{Wang2012c,
abstract = {Two-component systems mediate bacterial signal transduction, employing a membrane sensor kinase and a cytoplasmic response regulator (RR). Environmental sensing is typically coupled to gene regulation. Understanding how input stimuli activate kinase autophosphorylation remains obscure. The EnvZ/OmpR system regulates expression of outer membrane proteins in response to osmotic stress. To identify EnvZ conformational changes associated with osmosensing, we used HDXMS to probe the effects of osmolytes (NaCl, sucrose) on the cytoplasmic domain of EnvZ (EnvZ(c)). Increasing osmolality decreased deuterium exchange localized to the four-helix bundle containing the autophosphorylation site (His(243)). EnvZ(c) exists as an ensemble of multiple conformations and osmolytes favoured increased helicity. High osmolality increased autophosphorylation of His(243), suggesting that these two events are linked. In-vivo analysis showed that the cytoplasmic domain of EnvZ was sufficient for osmosensing, transmembrane domains were not required. Our results challenge existing claims of robustness in EnvZ/OmpR and support a model where osmolytes promote intrahelical H-bonding enhancing helix stabilization, increasing autophosphorylation and downstream signalling. The model provides a conserved mechanism for signalling proteins that respond to diverse physical and mechanical stimuli.},

abstract = {DNA methylation has critical roles in the nervous system and has been traditionally considered to be restricted to CpG dinucleotides in metazoan genomes. Here we show that the single base-resolution DNA methylome from adult mouse dentate neurons consists of both CpG ({\~{}}75{\%}) and CpH ({\~{}}25{\%}) methylation (H = A/C/T). Neuronal CpH methylation is conserved in human brains, enriched in regions of low CpG density, depleted at protein-DNA interaction sites and anticorrelated with gene expression. Functionally, both methylated CpGs (mCpGs) and mCpHs can repress transcription in vitro and are recognized by methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) in neurons in vivo. Unlike most CpG methylation, CpH methylation is established de novo during neuronal maturation and requires DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) for active maintenance in postmitotic neurons. These characteristics of CpH methylation suggest that a substantially expanded proportion of the neuronal genome is under cytosine methylation regulation and provide a new foundation for understanding the role of this key epigenetic modification in the nervous system.},

@article{Yasir2011,
abstract = {As arguably the most successful parasite, Chlamydia is an obligate intracellular bacterium replicating inside a vacuole of eukaryotic host cells. The chlamydial vacuole does not fuse with the defense cell organelle lysosome. We previously showed that chlamydial infection increases markers of autophagy, an innate antimicrobial activity requiring lysosomal function. However, the work presented here demonstrates that p62, an autophagy protein that is degraded in lysosomes, either remained unchanged or increased in chlamydia-infected human epithelial, mouse fibroblast, and mouse macrophage cell lines. In addition, the activities of three lysosomal enzymes analyzed were diminished in chlamydia-infected macrophages. Bafilomycin A1 (BafA), a specific inhibitor of vacuolar ATPase (vATPase) required for lysosomal function, increased the growth of the human pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis (L2) in wild-type murine fibroblasts and macrophages but inhibited growth in the autophagy-deficient ATG5 −/− fibroblasts. BafA exhibited only slight inhibition or no effect on L2 growth in multiple human genital epithelial cell lines. In contrast to L2, the mouse pathogen Chlamydia muridarum (MoPn) was consistently inhibited by BafA in all cell lines examined, regardless of species origin and autophagy status. Finally, L2 but not MoPn grew more efficiently in the ATG5 −/− cells than in wild-type cells. These results suggest that there are two types of vATPase-bearing organelles that regulate chlamydial infection: one supports chlamydial infection, while the other plays a defensive role through autophagy when cells are artificially infected with certain chlamydiae that have not been adapted to the host species.},

abstract = {Mammalian cellular differentiation and development depend on stable, somatically heritable epigenetic switches. A good example is X chromosome inactivation, the random silencing of either the paternal or maternal X chromosome but not both. Once silenced, genes on the inactive X (Xi) remain genetically silent in all progeny cells, even though identical genes on the active X (Xa) in the same nucleus are expressed. In most human cells, reactivation of a silent gene on the Xi is below the level of detection (1). Methylation changes are frequent in cancer cells and difficult to distinguish from mutations, leading to the burgeoning field of cancer epigenetics (2, 3). Epigenetics, the study of changes in gene function that do not depend on changes in primary DNA sequence (4), depends on stable, heritable marking of DNA or chromatin. Because heritability is such a key feature, important questions are: What is the fidelity with which an epigenetic state is transmitted from one cell generation to the next? How frequent are mistakes? Are there epigenetic repair mechanisms? This Commentary will discuss three articles relevant to these questions: (i) an important study of methylation fidelity by Laird et al. (5) reported in this issue of PNAS, (ii) a recent study of de novo methylation by Chen et al. (6), and (iii) a kinetic treatment of dynamic, stochastic DNA methylation (7). [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {A remarkable epigenetic remodelling process occurs shortly after fertilization, which restores totipotency to the zygote. This involves global DNA demethylation, chromatin remodelling, genome spatial reorganization and substantial transcriptional changes. Key to these changes is the transition from the maternal environment of the oocyte to an embryonic-driven developmental expression programme, a process termed the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). Zygotic genome activation occurs predominantly at the two-cell stage in mice and the eight-cell stage in humans, yet the dynamics of its control are still mostly obscure. In recent years, partly due to single-cell and low-cell number epigenomic studies, our understanding of the epigenetic and chromatin landscape of preimplantation development has improved considerably. In this Review, we discuss the latest advances in the study of the MZT, focusing on DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications, local chromatin structure and higher-order genome organization. We also discuss key mechanistic studies that investigate the mode of action of chromatin regulators, transcription factors and non-coding RNAs during preimplantation development. Finally, we highlight areas requiring additional research, as well as new technological advances that could assist in eventually completing our understanding of the MZT.},

However, the extent of their impact on genome evolution, function, and disease remain a matter of intense interrogation. The rise of genomics and large-scale functional assays has shed new light on the multi-faceted activities of TEs and implies that they should no longer be marginalized. Here, we introduce the fundamental properties of TEs and their complex interactions with their cellular environment, which are crucial to understanding their impact and manifold consequences for organismal biology. While we draw examples primarily from mammalian systems, the core concepts outlined here are relevant to a broad range of organisms.},

Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p ≫ n case.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We report clinical safety and biochemical efficacy from a dose-ranging study of intravenously administered AVI-4658 phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. METHOD: We undertook an open-label, phase 2, dose-escalation study (0{\textperiodcentered}5, 1{\textperiodcentered}0, 2{\textperiodcentered}0, 4{\textperiodcentered}0, 10{\textperiodcentered}0, and 20{\textperiodcentered}0 mg/kg bodyweight) in ambulant patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy aged 5-15 years with amenable deletions in DMD. Participants had a muscle biopsy before starting treatment and after 12 weekly intravenous infusions of AVI-4658. The primary study objective was to assess safety and tolerability of AVI-4658. The secondary objectives were pharmacokinetic properties and the ability of AVI-4658 to induce exon 51 skipping and dystrophin restoration by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and immunoblotting. The study is registered, number NCT00844597. FINDINGS: 19 patients took part in the study. AVI-4658 was well tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events. AVI-4658 induced exon 51 skipping in all cohorts and new dystrophin protein expression in a significant dose-dependent (p=0{\textperiodcentered}0203), but variable, manner in boys from cohort 3 (dose 2 mg/kg) onwards. Seven patients responded to treatment, in whom mean dystrophin fluorescence intensity increased from 8{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} (95{\%} CI 7{\textperiodcentered}1-10{\textperiodcentered}6) to 16{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (10{\textperiodcentered}8-22{\textperiodcentered}0) of normal control after treatment (p=0{\textperiodcentered}0287). The three patients with the greatest responses to treatment had 21{\%}, 15{\%}, and 55{\%} dystrophin-positive fibres after treatment and these findings were confirmed with western blot, which showed an increase after treatment of protein levels from 2{\%} to 18{\%}, from 0{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} to 17{\%}, and from 0{\%} to 7{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} of normal muscle, respectively. The dystrophin-associated proteins $\alpha$-sarcoglycan and neuronal nitric oxide synthase were also restored at the sarcolemma. Analysis of the inflammatory infiltrate indicated a reduction of cytotoxic T cells in the post-treatment muscle biopsies in the two high-dose cohorts. INTERPRETATION: The safety and biochemical efficacy that we present show the potential of AVI-4658 to become a disease-modifying drug for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Several recent studies reported aging effects on DNA methylation levels of individual CpG dinucleotides. But it is not yet known whether aging-related consensus modules, in the form of clusters of correlated CpG markers, can be found that are present in multiple human tissues. Such a module could facilitate the understanding of aging effects on multiple tissues. RESULTS We therefore employed weighted correlation network analysis of 2,442 Illumina DNA methylation arrays from brain and blood tissues, which enabled the identification of an age-related co-methylation module. Module preservation analysis confirmed that this module can also be found in diverse independent data sets. Biological evaluation showed that module membership is associated with Polycomb group target occupancy counts, CpG island status and autosomal chromosome location. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the aging-related consensus module comprises genes that are involved in nervous system development, neuron differentiation and neurogenesis, and that it contains promoter CpGs of genes known to be down-regulated in early Alzheimer's disease. A comparison with a standard, non-module based meta-analysis revealed that selecting CpGs based on module membership leads to significantly increased gene ontology enrichment, thus demonstrating that studying aging effects via consensus network analysis enhances the biological insights gained. CONCLUSIONS Overall, our analysis revealed a robustly defined age-related co-methylation module that is present in multiple human tissues, including blood and brain. We conclude that blood is a promising surrogate for brain tissue when studying the effects of age on DNA methylation profiles.},

abstract = {The number of chromatin modifying and remodeling complexes implicated in genome control is growing faster than our understanding of the functional roles they play. We discuss recent in vitro experiments with biochemically defined chromatin templates that illuminate new aspects of action by histone acetyltransferases and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling engines in facilitating transcription. We review a number of studies that present an 'ordered recruitment' view of transcriptional activation, according to which various complexes enter and exit their target promoter in a set sequence, and at specific times, such that action by one complex sets the stage for the arrival of the next one. A consensus emerging from all these experiments is that the joint action by several types of chromatin remodeling machines can lead to a more profound alteration of the infrastructure of chromatin over a target promoter than could be obtained by these enzymes acting independently. In addition, it appears that in specific cases one type of chromatin structure alteration (e.g., histone hyperacetylation) is contingent upon prior alterations of a different sort (i.e., ATP-dependent remodeling of histone-DNA contacts). The striking differences between the precise sequence of action by various cofactors observed in these studies may be - at least in part - due to differences between the specific promoters studied, and distinct requirements exhibited by specific loci for chromatin remodeling based on their pre-existing nucleoprotein architecture.},

abstract = {The oncoprotein BCR-ABL transforms myeloid progenitor cells and is responsible for the development of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In transformed cells, BCR-ABL suppresses apoptosis as well as autophagy, a catabolic process in which cellular components are degraded by the lysosomal machinery. The mechanism by which BCR-ABL suppresses autophagy is not known. Here we report that in both mouse and human BCR-ABL-transformed cells, activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5), a prosurvival factor, suppresses autophagy but does not affect apoptosis. We find that BCR-ABL, through PI3K/AKT/FOXO4 signaling, transcriptionally up-regulates ATF5 expression and that ATF5, in turn, stimulates transcription of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR; also called mechanistic target of rapamycin), a well-established master negative-regulator of autophagy. Previous studies have shown that the BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib mesylate induces both apoptosis and autophagy, and that the resultant autophagy modulates the efficiency by which imatinib kills BCR-ABL-transformed cells. We demonstrate that imatinib-induced autophagy is because of inhibition of the BCR-ABL/PI3K/AKT/FOXO4/ATF5/mTOR pathway that we have identified in this study.},

abstract = {N6-Methyladenosine is found at internal positions of mRNA in higher eukaryotes. This post-transcriptional modification occurs at a frequency of one to three methylation/average mRNA molecule in mammalian cell lines and is sequence-specific. A highly conserved consensus recognition site for the methyltransferase has been determined from both viral and cellular messages, consisting of the sequence Pu(G/A)AC(U/A) (with A being methylated). Despite the ubiquity and the specificity of this modification, little is known about the mechanism of formation of N6-methyladenosine. Utilizing an in vitro methylation system from HeLa cell nuclear extracts, and a substrate RNA derived from the mRNA coding for bovine prolactin, the mRNA N6-adenosine methyltransferase has been characterized and partially purified. Unique among other characterized nucleic acid methyltransferases, the enzyme is composed of three components which are separable under non-denaturing conditions. The molecular masses of the components are 30, 200, and 875 kDa as determined by gel filtration and glycerol gradient sedimentation. The 200-kDa component appears to contain the S-adenosylmethionine-binding site on a 70-kDa subunit. The 875-kDa component has affinity for single-stranded DNA-agarose, suggesting that it may contain the mRNA-binding site. N6-Adenosine methyltransferase is not sensitive to treatment with micrococcal nuclease, nor to immunodepletion using an anti-trimethylguanosine antibody, suggesting that it does not contain an essential RNA component.},

abstract = {EnvZ is a sensory histidine kinase in Escherichia coli to regulate the phosphorylation of OmpR, its cognate response regulator, required for the expression of genes for outer membrane porin proteins. Here, we re-examined the recent paper Mattison and Kenney, in which the authors reported that phosphorylated OmpR (OmpR-P) is unable to bind to EnvZ, thus casting doubts on the role of the EnvZ phosphatase activity in vivo. Using an identical method, the Kd value for the interaction of the fluorescein-labelled OmpR (Fl-OmpR) with EnvZc was determined to be 1.96 +/- 0.28 micro M. We demonstrated that OmpR-P as well as OmpR inhibited the interaction of Fl-OmpR with EnvZc. Their 50{\%} inhibitory concentrations were 1.09 +/- 0.25 micro M and 0.89 +/- 0.14 micro M, respectively, under the conditions used. The interaction between His-10-OmpR and EnvZc was also inhibited almost equally with OmpR-P and OmpR. Fluorescein labelling of OmpR was highly heterogeneous as detected by mass spectrometry, even though it slightly affected the OmpR phosphorylation (kinase) and the dephosphorylation of OmpR-P (phosphatase), indicating that EnvZc is able to interact with Fl-OmpR or Fl-OmpR-P as well as with OmpR or OmpR-P as a substrate. We demonstrated that OmpR-P is able to interact with EnvZc with a similar affinity to OmpR and serves as an effective substrate for the EnvZ phosphatase. These findings support the hypothesis that osmotic signals regulate the level of the cellular concentration of OmpR-P by modulating the ratio of kinase to phosphatase activity of the bifunctional enzymatic activities of EnvZ.},

Association of the PilZ domain with a variety of other domains, including likely components of bacterial multidrug secretion system, could provide clues to multiple functions of the c-di-GMP in bacterial pathogenesis and cell development.},

abstract = {Genetic polymorphisms can shape the global landscape of DNA methylation, by either changing substrates for DNA methyltransferases or altering the DNA binding affinity of cis-regulatory proteins. The interactions between CpG methylation and genetic polymorphisms have been previously investigated by methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) and allele-specific methylation (ASM) analysis. However, it remains unclear whether these approaches can effectively and comprehensively identify all genetic variants that contribute to the inter-individual variation of DNA methylation levels. Here we used three independent approaches to systematically investigate the influence of genetic polymorphisms on variability in DNA methylation by characterizing the methylation state of 96 whole blood samples in 52 parent-child trios from 22 nuclear pedigrees. We performed targeted bisulfite sequencing with padlock probes to quantify the absolute DNA methylation levels at a set of 411,800 CpG sites in the human genome. With mid-parent offspring analysis (MPO), we identified 10,593 CpG sites that exhibited heritable methylation patterns, among which 70.1{\%} were SNPs directly present in methylated CpG dinucleotides. We determined the mQTL analysis identified 49.9{\%} of heritable CpG sites for which regulation occurred in a distal cis-regulatory manner, and that ASM analysis was only able to identify 5{\%}. Finally, we identified hundreds of clusters in the human genome for which the degree of variation of CpG methylation, as opposed to whether or not CpG sites were methylated, was associated with genetic polymorphisms, supporting a recent hypothesis on the genetic influence of phenotypic plasticity. These results show that cis-regulatory SNPs identified by mQTL do not comprise the full extent of heritable CpG methylation, and that ASM appears overall unreliable. Overall, the extent of genome-methylome interactions is well beyond what is detectible with the commonly used mQTL and ASM approaches, and is likely to include effects on plasticity.},

abstract = {Publication and archival of scientific results is still commonly considered the responsability of classical publishing companies. Classical forms of publishing, however, which center around printed narrative articles, no longer seem well-suited in the digital age. In particular, there exist currently no efficient, reliable, and agreed-upon methods for publishing scientific datasets, which have become increasingly important for science. In this article, we propose to design scientific data publishing as a web-based bottom-up process, without top-down control of central authorities such as publishing companies. Based on a novel combination of existing concepts and technologies, we present a server network to decentrally store and archive data in the form of nanopublications, an RDF-based format to represent scientific data. We show how this approach allows researchers to publish, retrieve, verify, and recombine datasets of nanopublications in a reliable and trustworthy manner, and we argue that this architecture could be used as a low-level data publication layer to serve the Semantic Web in general. Our evaluation of the current network shows that this system is efficient and reliable.},

abstract = {Post-translational modifications of histone variant H2A.Z accompany gene transactivation, but its modifying enzymes still remain elusive. Here, we reveal a hitherto unknown function of human KAT2A (GCN5) as a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) of H2A.Z at the promoters of a set of transactivated genes. Expression of these genes also depends on the DNA repair complex XPC–RAD23–CEN2. We established that XPC–RAD23–CEN2 interacts both with H2A.Z and KAT2A to drive the recruitment of the HAT at promoters and license H2A.Z acetylation. KAT2A selectively acetylates H2A.Z.1 versus H2A.Z.2 in vitro on several well-defined lysines and we unveiled that alanine-14 in H2A.Z.2 is responsible for inhibiting the activity of KAT2A. Notably, the use of a nonacetylable H2A.Z.1 mutant shows that H2A.Z.1ac recruits the epigenetic reader BRD2 to promote RNA polymerase II recruitment. Our studies identify KAT2A as an H2A.Z.1 HAT in mammals and implicate XPC–RAD23–CEN2 as a transcriptional co-activator licensing the reshaping of the promoter epigenetic landscape.},

abstract = {In vertebrates, methylation of cytosine at CpG sequences is implicated in stable and heritable patterns of gene expression. The classical model for inheritance, in which individual CpG sites are independent, provides no explanation for the observed non-random patterns of methylation. We first investigate the exact topology of CpG clustering in the human genome associated to CpG islands. Then, by pooling genomic CpG clusters on the basis of short distances between CpGs within and long distances outside clusters, we show a strong dependence of methylation on the number and density of CpG organization. CpG clusters with fewer, or less densely spaced, CpGs are predominantly hyper-methylated, while larger clusters are predominantly hypo-methylated. Intermediate clusters, however, are either hyper- or hypo-methylated but are rarely found in intermediate methylation states. We develop a model for spatially-dependent collaboration between CpGs, where methylated CpGs recruit methylation enzymes that can act on CpGs over an extended local region, while unmethylated CpGs recruit demethylation enzymes that act more strongly on nearby CpGs. This model can reproduce the effects of CpG clustering on methylation and produces stable and heritable alternative methylation states of CpG clusters, thus providing a coherent model for methylation inheritance and methylation patterning.},

abstract = {Epigenetic modifications are crucial for proper lineage specification and embryo development. To explore the chromatin modification landscapes in human ES cells, we profiled two histone modifications, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, by ChIP coupled with the paired-end ditags sequencing strategy. H3K4me3 was found to be a prevalent mark and occurred in close proximity to the promoters of two-thirds of total human genes. Among the H3K27me3 loci identified, 56{\%} are associated with promoters and the vast majority of them are comodified by H3K4me3. By deep-transcript digital counting, 80{\%} of H3K4me3 and 36{\%} of comodified promoters were found to be transcribed. Remarkably, we observed that different combinations of histone methylations are associated with genes from distinct functional categories. These global histone methylation maps provide an epigenetic framework that enables the discovery of novel transcriptional networks and delineation of different genetic compartments of the pluripotent cell genome. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

To test this hypothesis, age-associated changes in spontaneous mutation in different tissues of the body as well as the molecular nature of such changes should be examined. This kind of approach has become feasible only lately with a development of new transgenic mice suitable for mutation assay. Here, using one of these transgenic mice harboring lacZ gene, we have shown that the age-associated increase in spontaneous mutant frequency is common to all tissues examined; spleen, liver, heart, brain, skin and testis, while the rates of increase in mutant frequency differed among the tissues. DNA sequencing of the 496 lacZ mutants recovered from the tissues of newborn and old mice has revealed that spectra of mutations are similar at the two age points with G:C to A:T transition at CpG site being a predominant type of mutation. Furthermore, some mutations in old tissues are complex type and not found in tissues of newborn mice. These results suggest that similar mechanisms may be operating for mutation induction in fetal and postnatal aging process. In addition, the appearance of complex types of mutations in the old tissues suggests a unique cause for these mutations in aging tissues. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {CpG islands (CGIs) are prominent in the mammalian genome owing to their GC-rich base composition and high density of CpG dinucleotides. Most human gene promoters are embedded within CGIs that lack DNA methylation and coincide with sites of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), irrespective of transcriptional activity. In spite of these intriguing correlations, the functional significance of non-methylated CGI sequences with respect to chromatin structure and transcription is unknown. By performing a search for proteins that are common to all CGIs, here we show high enrichment for Cfp1, which selectively binds to non-methylated CpGs in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of a mono-allelically methylated CGI confirmed that Cfp1 specifically associates with non-methylated CpG sites in vivo. High throughput sequencing of Cfp1-bound chromatin identified a notable concordance with non-methylated CGIs and sites of H3K4me3 in the mouse brain. Levels of H3K4me3 at CGIs were markedly reduced in Cfp1-depleted cells, consistent with the finding that Cfp1 associates with the H3K4 methyltransferase Setd1 (refs 7, 8). To test whether non-methylated CpG-dense sequences are sufficient to establish domains of H3K4me3, we analysed artificial CpG clusters that were integrated into the mouse genome. Despite the absence of promoters, the insertions recruited Cfp1 and created new peaks of H3K4me3. The data indicate that a primary function of non-methylated CGIs is to genetically influence the local chromatin modification state by interaction with Cfp1 and perhaps other CpG-binding proteins.},

abstract = {Summary How repetitive elements, epigenetic modifications, and architectural proteins interact ensuring proper genome expression remains poorly understood. Here, we report regulatory mechanisms unveiling a central role of Alu elements (AEs) and RNA polymerase III transcription factor C (TFIIIC) in structurally and functionally modulating the genome via chromatin looping and histone acetylation. Upon serum deprivation, a subset of AEs pre-marked by the activity-dependent neuroprotector homeobox Protein (ADNP) and located near cell-cycle genes recruits TFIIIC, which alters their chromatin accessibility by direct acetylation of histone H3 lysine-18 (H3K18). This facilitates the contacts of AEs with distant CTCF sites near promoter of other cell-cycle genes, which also become hyperacetylated at H3K18. These changes ensure basal transcription of cell-cycle genes and are critical for their re-activation upon serum re-exposure. Our study reveals how direct manipulation of the epigenetic state of AEs by a general transcription factor regulates 3D genome folding and expression.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The incidence of hematologic cancers increases with age. These cancers are associated with recurrent somatic mutations in specific genes. We hypothesized that such mutations would be detectable in the blood of some persons who are not known to have hematologic disorders. METHODS We analyzed whole-exome sequencing data from DNA in the peripheral-blood cells of 17,182 persons who were unselected for hematologic phenotypes. We looked for somatic mutations by identifying previously characterized single-nucleotide variants and small insertions or deletions in 160 genes that are recurrently mutated in hematologic cancers. The presence of mutations was analyzed for an association with hematologic phenotypes, survival, and cardiovascular events. RESULTS Detectable somatic mutations were rare in persons younger than 40 years of age but rose appreciably in frequency with age. Among persons 70 to 79 years of age, 80 to 89 years of age, and 90 to 108 years of age, these clonal mutations were observed in 9.5{\%} (219 of 2300 persons), 11.7{\%} (37 of 317), and 18.4{\%} (19 of 103), respectively. The majority of the variants occurred in three genes: DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1. The presence of a somatic mutation was associated with an increase in the risk of hematologic cancer (hazard ratio, 11.1; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 3.9 to 32.6), an increase in all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.4; 95{\%} CI, 1.1 to 1.8), and increases in the risks of incident coronary heart disease (hazard ratio, 2.0; 95{\%} CI, 1.2 to 3.4) and ischemic stroke (hazard ratio, 2.6; 95{\%} CI, 1.4 to 4.8). CONCLUSIONS Age-related clonal hematopoiesis is a common condition that is associated with increases in the risk of hematologic cancer and in all-cause mortality, with the latter possibly due to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

abstract = {Recent studies provide evidence of correlations of DNA methylation and expression of protein-coding genes with human aging. The relations of microRNA expression with age and age-related clinical outcomes have not been characterized thoroughly. We explored associations of age with whole-blood microRNA expression in 5221 adults and identified 127 microRNAs that were differentially expressed by age at P {\textless} 3.3 × 10-4 (Bonferroni-corrected). Most microRNAs were underexpressed in older individuals. Integrative analysis of microRNA and mRNA expression revealed changes in age-associated mRNA expression possibly driven by age-associated microRNAs in pathways that involve RNA processing, translation, and immune function. We fitted a linear model to predict 'microRNA age' that incorporated expression levels of 80 microRNAs. MicroRNA age correlated modestly with predicted age from DNA methylation (r = 0.3) and mRNA expression (r = 0.2), suggesting that microRNA age may complement mRNA and epigenetic age prediction models. We used the difference between microRNA age and chronological age as a biomarker of accelerated aging ($\Delta$age) and found that $\Delta$age was associated with all-cause mortality (hazards ratio 1.1 per year difference, P = 4.2 × 10-5 adjusted for sex and chronological age). Additionally, $\Delta$age was associated with coronary heart disease, hypertension, blood pressure, and glucose levels. In conclusion, we constructed a microRNA age prediction model based on whole-blood microRNA expression profiling. Age-associated microRNAs and their targets have potential utility to detect accelerated aging and to predict risks for age-related diseases.},

We develop a new method, based on chemical thermodynamics, for automatic detection of macromolecular assemblies in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) entries that are the results of X-ray diffraction experiments. As found, biological units may be recovered at 80-90{\%} success rate, which makes X-ray crystallography an important source of experimental data on macromolecular complexes and protein-protein interactions.

abstract = {Inheritance of 5-methyl cytosine modification of CpG (CG/CG) DNA sequences is needed to maintain early developmental decisions in vertebrates. The standard inheritance model treats CpGs as independent, with methylated CpGs maintained by efficient methylation of hemimethylated CpGs produced after DNA replication, and unmethylated CpGs maintained by an absence of de novo methylation. By stochastic simulations of CpG islands over multiple cell cycles and systematic sampling of reaction parameters, we show that the standard model is inconsistent with many experimental observations. In contrast, dynamic collaboration between CpGs can provide strong error-tolerant somatic inheritance of both hypermethylated and hypomethylated states of a cluster of CpGs, reproducing observed stable bimodal methylation patterns. Known recruitment of methylating enzymes by methylated CpGs could provide the necessary collaboration, but we predict that recruitment of demethylating enzymes by unmethylated CpGs strengthens inheritance and allows CpG islands to remain hypomethylated within a sea of hypermethylation.},

abstract = {The field of epigenetics is now capitalizing on the vast number of emerging technologies, largely based on second-generation sequencing, which interrogate DNA methylation status and histone modifications genome-wide. However, getting an exhaustive and unbiased view of a methylome at a reasonable cost is proving to be a significant challenge. In this article, we take a closer look at the impact of the DNA sequence and bias effects introduced to datasets by genome-wide DNA methylation technologies and where possible, explore the bioinformatics tools that deconvolve them. There remains much to be learned about the performance of genome-wide technologies, the data we mine from these assays and how it reflects the actual biology. While there are several methods to interrogate the DNA methylation status genome-wide, our opinion is that no single technique suitably covers the minimum criteria of high coverage and, high resolution at a reasonable cost. In fact, the fraction of the methylome that is studied currently depends entirely on the inherent biases of the protocol employed. There is promise for this to change, as the third generation of sequencing technologies is expected to again 'revolutionize' the way that we study genomes and epigenomes.},

abstract = {Summary DNA methylation is an important mechanism regulating gene transcription, and its role in carcinogenesis has been extensively studied. Hyper and hypomethylation of genes is a major mechanism of gene expression deregulation in a wide range of diseases. At the same time, high-throughput DNA methylation assays have been developed generating vast amounts of genome wide DNA methylation measurements. We developed MethylMix, an algorithm implemented in R to identify disease specific hyper and hypomethylated genes. Here we present a new version of MethylMix that automates the construction of DNA-methylation and gene expression datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). More precisely, MethylMix 2.0 incorporates two major updates: the automated downloading of DNA methylation and gene expression datasets from TCGA and the automated preprocessing of such datasets: value imputation, batch correction and CpG sites clustering within each gene. The resulting datasets can subsequently be analyzed with MethylMix to identify transcriptionally predictive methylation states. We show that the Differential Methylation Values created by MethylMix can be used for cancer subtyping. Availability and implementation MethylMix 2.0 was implemented as an R package and is available in bioconductor. https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MethylMix.html.},

abstract = {Although previous studies demonstrated circular RNAs (circRNAs) does not exclusively comprise mRNA exons, no study has extensively explored their internal structure. By combining an algorithm with long-read sequencing data and experimental validation, we, for the first time, comprehensively investigate internal components of circRNAs in 10 human cell lines and 62 fruit fly samples, and reveal the prevalence of alternative splicing (AS) events within circRNAs. Significantly, a large proportion of circRNA AS exons can hardly be detected in mRNAs and are enriched with binding sites of distinct splicing factors from those enriched in mRNA exons. We find that AS events in circRNAs have a preference towards nucleus localization and exhibit tissue- and developmental stage-specific expression patterns. This study suggests an independent regulation on the biogenesis or decay of AS events in circRNAs and the identified circular AS isoforms provide targets for future studies on circRNA formation and function.},

Furthermore, MeRIP-PF also achieves gene annotation of m(6)A signals or peaks and produce outputs in both XLS and graphical format, which are useful for further study.

At the time, FTO was a gene of unknown function and it was not known whether these SNPs exerted their effect on adiposity by affecting FTO or neighboring genes. Therefore, this breakthrough association inspired a wealth of in silico, in vitro, and in vivo analyses in model organisms and humans to improve knowledge of FTO function. These studies suggested that FTO plays a role in controlling feeding behavior and energy expenditure. Here, we review the approaches taken that provide a blueprint for the study of other obesity-associated genes in the hope that this strategy will result in increased understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying body weight regulation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Mutant lymphocytes were isolated by immunoselection, cloned at limiting dilution and enumerated, and the HLA-A gene and other polymorphic gene loci on chromosome 6 were studied by Southern blotting to determine gene dosage and loss of heterozygosity. Results of 167 assays in 73 individuals showed that the total number of mutant lymphocytes increased significantly with age from a geometric mean frequency of 0.71 x 10(-5) in neonates to 6.53 x 10(-5) in elderly individuals. Analysis of rearrangement of T lymphocyte receptor beta or gamma chain genes gave a best estimate of 3.3{\%} for the proportion of mutant lymphocytes detected which are clonally related. Molecular study of 434 mutants from 31 individuals showed no change on Southern blotting in 64.7{\%}, gene deletion in 2.8{\%} and mitotic recombination in 32.5{\%}. Two mutants due to gene conversion but no mutants due to non-disjunction were detected. The number of 'no change' and recombination mutants increased significantly with age. There was a significant difference between individuals in the proportion of mutants which resulted from mitotic recombination and the data suggested that the proportion was bimodally distributed.

The manifestations of mitochondrial dysfunction and the response to therapy vary between individuals. This probably reflects the genetic complexity of mitochondrial biology, which requires an excess of 2000 genes for proper function, with numerous interfering epigenetic and environmental factors. Accordingly, we are increasingly aware of the complexity of these diseases which involve far more than merely decreased ATP supply. Indeed, recent therapeutic progress has addressed only specific disease entities. In this review present and prospective therapeutic approaches will be discussed on the basis of targets and mechanism of action, but with a broad outlook on their potential applications.},

abstract = {We performed transposon mutagenesis of a two-color fluorescent reporter strain to identify new regulators of the porin genes ompF and ompC in Escherichia coli. Screening of colonies by fluorescence microscopy revealed numerous mutants that exhibited interesting patterns of porin expression. One mutant harbored an insertion in the gene encoding the histidine kinase CpxA, the sensor for a two-component signaling system that responds to envelope stress. The cpxA mutant exhibited increased transcription of ompC and a very strong decrease in transcription of ompF under conditions in which acetyl phosphate levels were high. Subsequent genetic analysis revealed that this phenotype is dependent on phosphorylation of the response regulator CpxR and that activation of CpxA in wild-type cells results in similar regulation of porin expression. Using DNase I footprinting, we demonstrated that CpxR binds upstream of both the ompF and ompC promoters. It thus appears that two distinct two-component systems, CpxA-CpxR and EnvZ-OmpR, converge at the porin promoters. Within the context of envelope stress, outer membrane beta-barrel proteins have generally been associated with the sigma E pathway. However, at least for the classical porins OmpF and OmpC, our results show that the Cpx envelope stress response system plays a role in regulating their expression.},

abstract = {Aging associates with progressive loss of skeletal muscle function, sometimes leading to sarcopenia, a process characterized by impaired mobility and weakening of muscle strength. Since aging associates with profound epigenetic changes, epigenetic landscape alteration analysis in the skeletal muscle promises to highlight molecular mechanisms of age-associated alteration in skeletal muscle. This study was conducted exploiting the short-lived turquoise killifish Nothobranchius furzeri (Nfu), a relatively new model for aging studies. The epigenetic analysis suggested a less accessible and more condensed chromatin in old Nfu skeletal muscle. Specifically, an accumulation of heterochromatin regions was observed as a consequence of increased levels of H3K27me3, HP1$\alpha$, polycomb complex subunits, and senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHFs). Consistently, euchromatin histone marks, including H3K9ac, were significantly reduced. In this context, integrated bioinformatics analysis of RNASeq and ChIPSeq, related to skeletal muscle of Nfu at different ages, revealed a down-modulation of genes involved in cell cycle, differentiation, and DNA repair and an up-regulation of inflammation and senescence genes. Undoubtedly, more studies are needed to disclose the detailed mechanisms; however, our approach enlightened unprecedented features of Nfu skeletal muscle aging, potentially associated with swimming impairment and reduced mobility typical of old Nfu.},

abstract = {Translation of a gene is assumed to be efficient if the supply of the tRNAs that translate it is high. Yet high-abundance tRNAs are often also at high demand since they correspond to preferred codons in genomes. Thus to fully model translational efficiency one must gauge the supply-to-demand ratio of the tRNAs that are required by the transcriptome at a given time. The tRNAs' supply is often approximated by their gene copy number in the genome. Yet neither the demand for each tRNA nor the extent to which its concentration changes across environmental conditions has been extensively examined. Here we compute changes in the codon usage of the transcriptome across different conditions in several organisms by inspecting conventional mRNA expression data. We find recurring dynamics of codon usage in the transcriptome in multiple stressful conditions. In particular, codons that are translated by rare tRNAs become over-represented in the transcriptome in response to stresses. These results raise the possibility that the tRNA pool might dynamically change upon stress to support efficient translation of stress-transcribed genes. Alternatively, stress genes may be typically translated with low efficiency, presumably due to lack of sufficient evolutionary optimization pressure on their codon usage.},

abstract = {RNA polymerase III (pol III) synthesizes short non-coding RNAs, many of which are essential for translation. Accordingly, pol III activity is tightly regulated with cell growth and proliferation by factors such as MYC, RB1, TRP53, and MAF1. MAF1 is a repressor of pol III transcription whose activity is controlled by phosphorylation; in particular, it is inactivated through phosphorylation by the TORC1 kinase complex, a sensor of nutrient availability. Pol III regulation is thus sensitive to environmental cues, yet a diurnal profile of pol III transcription activity is so far lacking. Here we first use gene expression arrays to measure mRNA accumulation during the diurnal cycle in the livers of (i) wild-type mice, (ii) arrhythmic Arntl knockout mice, (iii) mice fed at regular intervals during both night and day, and (iv) mice lacking the Maf1 gene, and so provide a comprehensive view of the changes in cyclic mRNA accumulation occurring in these different systems. We then show that pol III occupancy of its target genes rises before the onset of the night, stays high during the night, when mice normally ingest food and when translation is known to be increased, and decreases in daytime. Whereas higher pol III occupancy during the night reflects a MAF1-dependent response to feeding, the rise of pol III occupancy before the onset of the night reflects a circadian clock-dependent response. Thus, pol III transcription during the diurnal cycle is regulated both in response to nutrients and by the circadian clock, which allows anticipatory pol III transcription.},

abstract = {The ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is the most evolutionarily conserved segment of the genome and gives origin to the nucleolus, an energy intensive nuclear organelle and major hub influencing myriad molecular processes from cellular metabolism to epigenetic states of the genome. The rDNA/nucleolus has been directly and mechanistically implicated in aging and longevity in organisms as diverse as yeasts, Drosophila, and humans. The rDNA is also a significant target of DNA methylation that silences supernumerary rDNA units and regulates nucleolar activity. Here, we introduce an age clock built exclusively with CpG methylation within the rDNA. The ribosomal clock is sufficient to accurately estimate individual age within species, is responsive to genetic and environmental interventions that modulate life-span, and operates across species as distant as humans, mice, and dogs. Further analyses revealed a significant excess of age-associated hypermethylation in the rDNA relative to other segments of the genome, and which forms the basis of the rDNA clock. Our observations identified an evolutionarily conserved marker of aging that is easily ascertained, grounded on nucleolar biology, and could serve as a universal marker to gauge individual age and response to interventions in humans as well as laboratory and wild organisms across a wide diversity of species.},

abstract = {Although measures to enhance bone mineralization during childhood and adolescence are widely incorporated into preventive programmes against osteoporotic fracture, there are no published data directly linking growth rates in childhood with the risk of later hip fracture. We addressed this issue in a unique Finnish cohort in whom birth and childhood growth data were linked to later hospital discharge records. This permitted follow-up of 3639 men and 3447 women who were born in Helsinki University Central Hospital between 1924 and 1933, who went to school in Helsinki and still lived in Finland in 1971. Body size at birth was recorded and an average of 10 measurements were obtained of height and weight throughout childhood. We identified 112 subjects (55 men and 57 women) who sustained a hip fracture during 165 404 person-years of follow-up. After adjustment for age and sex in a proportional hazards model, we identified two major determinants of hip fracture risk: tall maternal height (p{\textless}0.001) and a low rate of childhood growth (height, p = 0.006; weight, p = 0.01). The hazard ratio for hip fracture was 2.1 (95{\%} CI 1.2-3.5) among men and women born to mothers taller than 1.61 m, when compared with those whose mothers were shorter than 1.54 m. The ratio was 1.9 (95{\%} CI 1.1-3.2) among those whose rate of childhood height gain was below the lowest quartile for the cohort, compared with those whose growth rate was above the highest quartile. The effects of maternal height and childhood growth rate were statistically independent of each other, and remained after adjusting for socio-economic status. The patterns of childhood growth that predicted future hip fracture differed between boys and girls. In boys, there was a constant deficit in height and weight between ages 7 and 15 years among those later sustaining fractures; in girls, there was a progressively increasing deficit in weight but a delayed height gain among those later sustaining fractures. This epidemiologic study provides the first direct evidence that a low rate of childhood growth is a risk factor for later hip fracture. Whether reduced growth rate is a consequence of childhood lifestyle, genetic background or intrauterine hormonal programming, the data support measures to optimize childhood growth as part of preventive strategies against osteoporotic fracture in future generations.},

abstract = {FTO (fat mass and obesity associated) was identified as an obesity-susceptibility gene by several independent large-scale genome association studies. A cluster of SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphism) located in the first intron of FTO was found to be significantly associated with obesity-related traits, such as body mass index, hip circumference, and body weight. FTO encodes a protein with a novel C-terminal $\alpha$-helical domain and an N-terminal double-strand $\beta$-helix domain which is conserved in Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase family. In vitro, FTO protein can demethylate single-stranded DNA or RNA with a preference for 3-methylthymine or 3-methyluracil. Its physiological substrates and function, however, remain to be defined. Here we report the generation and analysis of mice carrying a conditional deletion allele of Fto. Our results demonstrate that Fto plays an essential role in postnatal growth. The mice lacking Fto completely display immediate postnatal growth retardation with shorter body length, lower body weight, and lower bone mineral density than control mice, but their body compositions are relatively normal. Consistent with the growth retardation, the Fto mutant mice have reduced serum levels of IGF-1. Moreover, despite the ubiquitous expression of Fto, its specific deletion in the nervous system results in similar phenotypes as the whole body deletion, indicating that Fto functions in the central nerve system to regulate postnatal growth.},

abstract = {Background Statistical models that use an individual's DNA methylation levels to estimate their age (known as epigenetic clocks) have recently been developed, with 96{\%} correlation found between epigenetic and chronological age. We postulate that differences between estimated and actual age [age acceleration (AA)] can be used as a measure of developmental age in early life. Methods We obtained DNA methylation measures at three time points (birth, age 7 years and age 17 years) in 1018 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Using an online calculator, we estimated epigenetic age, and thus AA, for each child at each time point. We then investigated whether AA was prospectively associated with repeated measures of height, weight, body mass index (BMI), bone mineral density, bone mass, fat mass, lean mass and Tanner stage. Results Positive AA at birth was associated with higher average fat mass [1321 g per year of AA, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 386, 2256 g] from birth to adolescence (i.e. from age 0-17 years) and AA at age 7 was associated with higher average height (0.23 cm per year of AA, 95{\%} CI 0.04, 0.41 cm). Conflicting evidence for the role of AA (at birth and in childhood) on changes during development was also found, with higher AA being positively associated with changes in weight, BMI and Tanner stage, but negatively with changes in height and fat mass. Conclusions We found evidence that being ahead of one's epigenetic age acceleration is related to developmental characteristics during childhood and adolescence. This demonstrates the potential for using AA as a measure of development in future research.},

abstract = {Dnmt1 epigenetically propagates symmetrical CG methylation in many eukaryotes. Their genomes are typically depleted of CG dinucleotides because of imperfect repair of deaminated methylcytosines. Here, we extensively survey diverse species lacking Dnmt1 and show that, surprisingly, symmetrical CG methylation is nonetheless frequently present and catalyzed by a different DNA methyltransferase family, Dnmt5. Numerous Dnmt5-containing organisms that diverged more than a billion years ago exhibit clustered methylation, specifically in nucleosome linkers. Clustered methylation occurs at unprecedented densities and directly disfavors nucleosomes, contributing to nucleosome positioning between clusters. Dense methylation is enabled by a regime of genomic sequence evolution that enriches CG dinucleotides and drives the highest CG frequencies known. Species with linker methylation have small, transcriptionally active nuclei that approach the physical limits of chromatin compaction. These features constitute a previously unappreciated genome architecture, in which dense methylation influences nucleosome positions, likely facilitating nuclear processes under extreme spatial constraints.},

abstract = {Monozygous twins share a common genotype. However, most monozygotic twin pairs are not identical; several types of phenotypic discordance may be observed, such as differences in susceptibilities to disease and a wide range of anthropomorphic features. There are several possible explanations for these observations, but one is the existence of epigenetic differences. To address this issue, we examined the global and locus-specific differences in DNA methylation and histone acetylation of a large cohort of monozygotic twins. We found that, although twins are epigenetically indistinguishable during the early years of life, older monozygous twins exhibited remarkable differences in their overall content and genomic distribution of 5-methylcytosine DNA and histone acetylation, affecting their gene-expression portrait. These findings indicate how an appreciation of epigenetics is missing from our understanding of how different phenotypes can be originated from the same genotype.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Short-term exposures to fine ({\textless}2.5 $\mu$m aerodynamic diameter) ambient particulate-matter (PM) have been related with increased blood pressure (BP) in controlled-human exposure and community-based studies. However, whether coarse (2.5 to 10 $\mu$m) PM exposure increases BP is uncertain. Recent observational studies have linked PM exposures with blood DNA hypomethylation, an epigenetic alteration that activates inflammatory and vascular responses. No experimental evidence is available to confirm those observational data and demonstrate the relations between PM, hypomethylation, and BP. METHODS AND RESULTS We conducted a cross-over trial of controlled-human exposure to concentrated ambient particles (CAPs). Fifteen healthy adult participants were exposed for 130 minutes to fine CAPs, coarse CAPs, or HEPA-filtered medical air (control) in randomized order with ≥2-week washout. Repetitive-element (Alu, long interspersed nuclear element-1 [LINE-1]) and candidate-gene (TLR4, IL-12, IL-6, iNOS) blood methylation, systolic and diastolic BP were measured pre- and postexposure. After adjustment for multiple comparisons, fine CAPs exposure lowered Alu methylation ($\beta$-standardized=-0.74, adjusted-P=0.03); coarse CAPs exposure lowered TLR4 methylation ($\beta$-standardized=-0.27, adjusted-P=0.04). Both fine and coarse CAPs determined significantly increased systolic BP ($\beta$=2.53 mm Hg, P=0.001; $\beta$=1.56 mm Hg, P=0.03, respectively) and nonsignificantly increased diastolic BP ($\beta$=0.98 mm Hg, P=0.12; $\beta$=0.82 mm Hg, P=0.11, respectively). Decreased Alu and TLR4 methylation was associated with higher postexposure DBP ($\beta$-standardized=0.41, P=0.04; and $\beta$-standardized=0.84, P=0.02; respectively). Decreased TLR4 methylation was associated with higher postexposure SBP ($\beta$-standardized=1.45, P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS Our findings provide novel evidence of effects of coarse PM on BP and confirm effects of fine PM. Our results provide the first experimental evidence of PM-induced DNA hypomethylation and its correlation to BP.},

abstract = {Phospholipids containing highly polyunsaturated fatty acids are particularly prone to peroxidation and membrane composition may therefore influence longevity. Phospholipid molecules, in particular those containing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), from the skeletal muscle, heart, liver and liver mitochondria were identified and quantified using mass-spectrometry shotgun lipidomics in two similar-sized rodents that show an approximately 9-fold difference in maximum lifespan. The naked mole rat is the longest-living rodent known with a maximum lifespan of {\textgreater}28 years. Total phospholipid distribution is similar in tissues of both species; DHA is only found in phosphatidylcholines (PC), phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) and phosphatidylserines (PS), and DHA is relatively more concentrated in PE than PC. Naked mole-rats have fewer molecular species of both PC and PE than do mice. DHA-containing phospholipids represent 27-57{\%} of all phospholipids in mice but only 2-6{\%} in naked mole-rats. Furthermore, while mice have small amounts of di-polyunsaturated PC and PE, these are lacking in naked mole-rats. Vinyl ether-linked phospholipids (plasmalogens) are higher in naked mole-rat tissues than in mice. The lower level of DHA-containing phospholipids suggests a lower susceptibility to peroxidative damage in membranes of naked mole-rats compared to mice. Whereas the high level of plasmalogens might enhance membrane antioxidant protection in naked mole-rats compared to mice. Both characteristics possibly contribute to the exceptional longevity of naked mole-rats and may indicate a special role for peroxisomes in this extended longevity.},

Now, novel bioinformatic approaches coupled with biochemical enrichment strategies and deep sequencing have allowed comprehensive studies of circular RNA species. Recent studies have revealed thousands of endogenous circular RNAs in mammalian cells, some of which are highly abundant and evolutionarily conserved. Evidence is emerging that some circRNAs might regulate microRNA (miRNA) function, and roles in transcriptional control have also been suggested. Therefore, study of this class of noncoding RNAs has potential implications for therapeutic and research applications. We believe the key future challenge for the field will be to understand the regulation and function of these unusual molecules.},

abstract = {Besides linear RNAs, pre-mRNA splicing generates three forms of RNAs: lariat introns, Y-structure introns from trans-splicing, and circular exons through exon skipping. To study the persistence of excised introns in total cellular RNA, we used three Escherichia coli 3' to 5' exoribonucleases. Ribonuclease R (RNase R) thoroughly degrades the abundant linear RNAs and the Y-structure RNA, while preserving the loop portion of a lariat RNA. Ribonuclease II (RNase II) and polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) also preserve the lariat loop, but are less efficient in degrading linear RNAs. RNase R digestion of the total RNA from human skeletal muscle generates an RNA pool consisting of lariat and circular RNAs. RT-PCR across the branch sites confirmed lariat RNAs and circular RNAs in the pool generated by constitutive and alternative splicing of the dystrophin pre-mRNA. Our results indicate that RNase R treatment can be used to construct an intronic cDNA library, in which majority of the intron lariats are represented. The highly specific activity of RNase R implies its ability to screen for rare intragenic trans-splicing in any target gene with a large background of cis-splicing. Further analysis of the intronic RNA pool from a specific tissue or cell will provide insights into the global profile of alternative splicing.},

abstract = {Added by telomerase, arrays of TTAGGG repeats specify the ends of human chromosomes. A complex formed by six telomere-specific proteins associates with this sequence and protects chromosome ends. By analogy to other chromosomal protein complexes such as condensin and cohesin, I will refer to this complex as shelterin. Three shelterin subunits, TRF1, TRF2, and POT1 directly recognize TTAGGG repeats. They are interconnected by three additional shelterin proteins, TIN2, TPP1, and Rap1, forming a complex that allows cells to distinguish telomeres from sites of DNA damage. Without the protective activity of shelterin, telomeres are no longer hidden from the DNA damage surveillance and chromosome ends are inappropriately processed by DNA repair pathways. How does shelterin avert these events? The current data argue that shelterin is not a static structural component of the telomere. Instead, shelterin is emerging as a protein complex with DNA remodeling activity that acts together with several associated DNA repair factors to change the structure of the telomeric DNA, thereby protecting chromosome ends. Six shelterin subunits: TRF1, TRF2, TIN2, Rap1, TPP1, and POT1.},

Maternal smoking in pregnancy remains an important public health problem that impacts child health in a myriad of ways and has potential lifelong consequences. The mechanisms are largely unknown, but epigenetics most likely plays a role. We formed the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetics (PACE) consortium and meta-analyzed, across 13 cohorts (n = 6,685), the association between maternal smoking in pregnancy and newborn blood DNA methylation at over 450,000 CpG sites (CpGs) by using the Illumina 450K BeadChip. Over 6,000 CpGs were differentially methylated in relation to maternal smoking at genome-wide statistical significance (false discovery rate, 5{\%}), including 2,965 CpGs corresponding to 2,017 genes not previously related to smoking and methylation in either newborns or adults. Several genes are relevant to diseases that can be caused by maternal smoking (e.g., orofacial clefts and asthma) or adult smoking (e.g., certain cancers). A number of differentially methylated CpGs were associated with gene expression. We observed enrichment in pathways and processes critical to development. In older children (5 cohorts, n = 3,187), 100{\%} of CpGs gave at least nominal levels of significance, far more than expected by chance (p value {\textless} 2.2 × 10(-16)). Results were robust to different normalization methods used across studies and cell type adjustment. In this large scale meta-analysis of methylation data, we identified numerous loci involved in response to maternal smoking in pregnancy with persistence into later childhood and provide insights into mechanisms underlying effects of this important exposure.},

abstract = {Introns are found in various tRNA genes in all the three kingdoms of life. Especially, archaeal and eukaryotic genomes are good sources of tRNA introns that are removed by proteinaceous splicing machinery. Most intron-containing tRNA genes both in archaea and eukaryotes possess an intron at a so-called canonical position, one nucleotide 3' to their anticodon, while recent bioinformatics have revealed unusual types of tRNA introns and their derivatives especially in archaeal genomes. Gain and loss of tRNA introns during various stages of evolution are obvious both in archaea and eukaryotes from analyses of comparative genomics. The splicing of tRNA molecules has been studied extensively from biochemical and cell biological points of view, and such analyses of eukaryotic systems provided interesting findings in the past years. Here, I summarize recent progresses in the analyses of tRNA introns and the splicing process, and try to clarify new and old questions to be solved in the next stages.},

abstract = {DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification involved in many biological processes and diseases. Recent developments in whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) technology have enabled genome-wide measurements of DNA methylation at single base pair resolution. Many experiments have been conducted to compare DNA methylation profiles under different biological contexts, with the goal of identifying differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Due to the high cost of WGBS experiments, many studies are still conducted without biological replicates. Methods and tools available for analyzing such data are very limited.We develop a statistical method, DSS-single, for detecting DMRs from WGBS data without replicates. We characterize the count data using a rigorous model that accounts for the spatial correlation of methylation levels, sequence depth and biological variation. We demonstrate that using information from neighboring CG sites, biological variation can be estimated accurately even without replicates. DMR detection is then carried out via a Wald test procedure. Simulations demonstrate that DSS-single has greater sensitivity and accuracy than existing methods, and an analysis of H1 versus IMR90 cell lines suggests that it also yields the most biologically meaningful results. DSS-single is implemented in the Bioconductor package DSS.},

abstract = {Behavioral and lifestyle factors have been shown to relate to a number of health-related outcomes, yet there is a need for studies that examine their relationship to molecular aging rates. Toward this end, we use recent epigenetic biomarkers of age that have previously been shown to predict all-cause mortality, chronic conditions, and age-related functional decline. We analyze cross-sectional data from 4,173 postmenopausal female participants from the Women's Health Initiative, as well as 402 male and female participants from the Italian cohort study, Invecchiare nel Chianti.Extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (EEAA) exhibits significant associations with fish intake (p=0.02), moderate alcohol consumption (p=0.01), education (p=3x10-5), BMI (p=0.01), and blood carotenoid levels (p=1x10-5)-an indicator of fruit and vegetable consumption, whereas intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (IEAA) is associated with poultry intake (p=0.03) and BMI (p=0.05). Both EEAA and IEAA were also found to relate to indicators of metabolic syndrome, which appear to mediate their associations with BMI. Metformin-the first-line medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes-does not delay epigenetic aging in this observational study. Finally, longitudinal data suggests that an increase in BMI is associated with increase in both EEAA and IEAA.Overall, the epigenetic age analysis of blood confirms the conventional wisdom regarding the benefits of eating a high plant diet with lean meats, moderate alcohol consumption, physical activity, and education, as well as the health risks of obesity and metabolic syndrome.},

abstract = {CbbR and RegA (PrrA) are transcriptional regulators of the cbb(I) and cbb(II) (Calvin-Benson-Bassham CO(2) fixation pathway) operons of Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Both proteins interact specifically with promoter sequences of the cbb operons. RegA has four DNA binding sites within the cbb(I) promoter region, with the CbbR binding site and RegA binding site 1 overlapping each other. This study demonstrated that CbbR and RegA interact and form a discrete complex in vitro, as illustrated by gel mobility shift experiments, direct isolation of the proteins from DNA complexes, and chemical cross-linking analyses. For CbbR/RegA interactions to occur, CbbR must be bound to the DNA, with the ability of CbbR to bind the cbb(I) promoter enhanced by RegA. Conversely, interactions with CbbR did not require RegA to bind the cbb(I) promoter. RegA itself formed incrementally larger multimeric complexes with DNA as the concentration of RegA increased. The presence of RegA binding sites 1, 2 and 3 promoted RegA/DNA binding at significantly lower concentrations of RegA than when RegA binding site 3 was not present in the cbb(I) promoter. These studies support the premise that both CbbR and RegA are necessary for optimal transcription of the cbb(I) operon genes of R. sphaeroides.},

There are mainly two types of tsRNAs, including tRNA-derived stress-induced RNA (tiRNA) and tRNA-derived fragment (tRF), which differ in the cleavage position of the precursor or mature tRNA transcript. Emerging evidence has shown that tsRNAs are not merely tRNA degradation debris but have been recognized to play regulatory roles in many specific physiological and pathological processes. In this review, we summarize the biogeneses of various tsRNAs, present the emerging concepts regarding functions and mechanisms of action of tsRNAs, highlight the potential application of tsRNAs in human diseases, and put forward the current problems and future research directions.},

Complex manipulation techniques and maternal stores of proteins preclude large-scale functional screens for ZGA regulators within early embryos. Here, we combined pooled CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) with single-cell transcriptomics to identify regulators of ZGA-like transcription in mouse embryonic stem cells, which serve as a tractable, in vitro proxy of early mouse embryos. Using multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA+) applied to ∼200,000 single-cell transcriptomes comprising 230 CRISPRa perturbations, we characterized molecular signatures of ZGA and uncovered 24 factors that promote a ZGA-like response. Follow-up assays validated top screen hits, including the DNA-binding protein Dppa2, the chromatin remodeler Smarca5, and the transcription factor Patz1, and functional experiments revealed that Smarca5's regulation of ZGA-like transcription is dependent on Dppa2. Together, our single-cell transcriptomic profiling of CRISPRa-perturbed cells provides both system-level and molecular insights into the mechanisms that orchestrate ZGA.},

abstract = {Pathogenic variants in BRCA1 or BRCA2 are identified in ∼20{\%} of families with multiple individuals affected by early-onset breast and/or ovarian cancer. Extensive searches for additional highly penetrant genes or alternative mutational mechanisms altering BRCA1 or BRCA2 have not explained the missing heritability. Here, we report a dominantly inherited 5′ UTR variant associated with epigenetic BRCA1 silencing due to promoter hypermethylation in two families affected by breast and ovarian cancer. BRCA1 promoter methylation of ten CpG dinucleotides in families who are affected by breast and/or ovarian cancer but do not have germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variants was assessed by pyrosequencing and clonal bisulfite sequencing. RNA and DNA sequencing of BRCA1 from lymphocytes was undertaken to establish allelic expression and the presence of germline variants. BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation was identified in 2 of 49 families in which multiple women are affected by grade 3 breast cancer or high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Soma-wide BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation was confirmed in blood, buccal mucosa, and hair follicles. Pyrosequencing showed that DNA was ∼50{\%} methylated, consistent with the silencing of one allele, which was confirmed by clonal bisulfite sequencing. RNA sequencing revealed the allelic loss of BRCA1 expression in both families and that this loss of expression segregated with the heterozygous variant c.−107A{\textgreater}T in the BRCA1 5′ UTR. Our results establish a mechanism whereby familial breast and ovarian cancer is caused by an in cis 5′ UTR variant associated with epigenetic silencing of the BRCA1 promoter in two independent families. We propose that methylation analyses be undertaken to establish the frequency of this mechanism in families affected by early-onset breast and/or ovarian cancer without a BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variant.},

abstract = {The mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, linking glycolysis to the tricarboxylic acid cycle and fatty acid (FA) synthesis. Knowledge of the mechanisms that regulate PDC activity is important, because PDC inactivation is crucial for glucose conservation when glucose is scarce, whereas adequate PDC activity is required to allow both ATP and FA production from glucose. The mechanisms that control mammalian PDC activity include its phosphorylation (inactivation) by a family of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs 1-4) and its dephosphorylation (activation, reactivation) by the pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphate phosphatases (PDPs 1 and 2). Isoform-specific differences in kinetic parameters, regulation, and phosphorylation site specificity of the PDKs introduce variations in the regulation of PDC activity in differing endocrine and metabolic states. In this review, we summarize recent significant advances in our knowledge of the mechanisms regulating PDC with emphasis on the PDKs, in particular PDK4, whose expression is linked with sustained changes in tissue lipid handling and which may represent an attractive target for pharmacological interventions aimed at modulating whole body glucose, lipid, and lactate homeostasis in disease states.},

abstract = {Copy number variation (CNV) in the genome is a complex phenomenon, and not completely understood. We have developed a method, CNVnator, for CNV discovery and genotyping from read-depth (RD) analysis of personal genome sequencing. Our method is based on combining the established mean-shift approach with additional refinements (multiple-bandwidth partitioning and GC correction) to broaden the range of discovered CNVs. We calibrated CNVnator using the extensive validation performed by the 1000 Genomes Project. Because of this, we could use CNVnator for CNV discovery and genotyping in a population and characterization of atypical CNVs, such as de novo and multi-allelic events. Overall, for CNVs accessible by RD, CNVnator has high sensitivity (86{\%}-96{\%}), low false-discovery rate (3{\%}-20{\%}), high genotyping accuracy (93{\%}-95{\%}), and high resolution in breakpoint discovery ({\textless}200 bp in 90{\%} of cases with high sequencing coverage). Furthermore, CNVnator is complementary in a straightforward way to split-read and read-pair approaches: It misses CNVs created by retrotransposable elements, but more than half of the validated CNVs that it identifies are not detected by split-read or read-pair. By genotyping CNVs in the CEPH, Yoruba, and Chinese-Japanese populations, we estimated that at least 11{\%} of all CNV loci involve complex, multi-allelic events, a considerably higher estimate than reported earlier. Moreover, among these events, we observed cases with allele distribution strongly deviating from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, possibly implying selection on certain complex loci. Finally, by combining discovery and genotyping, we identified six potential de novo CNVs in two family trios.},

Here we show that inhibition of a specific tsRNA, LeuCAG3′tsRNA, induces apoptosis in rapidly dividing cells in vitro and in a patient-derived orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma model in mice. This tsRNA binds at least two ribosomal protein mRNAs (RPS28 and RPS15) to enhance their translation. A decrease in translation of RPS28 mRNA blocks pre-18S ribosomal RNA processing, resulting in a reduction in the number of 40S ribosomal subunits. These data establish a post-transcriptional mechanism that can fine-tune gene expression during different physiological states and provide a potential new target for treating cancer.},

abstract = {Autophagy is an intracellular bulk degradation process through which a portion of the cytoplasm is delivered to lysosomes to be degraded. Although the primary role of autophagy in many organisms is in adaptation to starvation, autophagy is also thought to be important for normal turnover of cytoplasmic contents, particularly in quiescent cells such as neurons. Autophagy may have a protective role against the development of a number of neurodegenerative diseases. Here we report that loss of autophagy causes neurodegeneration even in the absence of any disease-associated mutant proteins. Mice deficient for Atg5 (autophagy-related 5) specifically in neural cells develop progressive deficits in motor function that are accompanied by the accumulation of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in neurons. In Atg5-/- cells, diffuse, abnormal intracellular proteins accumulate, and then form aggregates and inclusions. These results suggest that the continuous clearance of diffuse cytosolic proteins through basal autophagy is important for preventing the accumulation of abnormal proteins, which can disrupt neural function and ultimately lead to neurodegeneration.},

In cerebellar samples, the SNP in 2p22.1 has a cis-effect on DHX57 (P=4.4 × 10(-5)). Gene sets found by our GWAS analysis of cerebellar age acceleration exhibit significant overlap with those of Alzheimer's disease (P=4.4 × 10(-15)), age-related macular degeneration (P=6.4 × 10(-6)), and Parkinson's disease (P=2.6 × 10(-4)). Overall, our results demonstrate the utility of a new paradigm for understanding aging and age-related diseases: it will be fruitful to use epigenetic tissue age as endophenotype in GWAS.},

@article{Zhai2017,
abstract = {Background: Many questions in statistical genomics can be formulated in terms of variable selection of candidate biological factors for modeling a trait or quantity of interest. Often, in these applications, additional covariates describing clinical, demographical or experimental effects must be included a priori as mandatory covariates while allowing the selection of a large number of candidate or optional variables. As genomic studies routinely require mandatory covariates, it is of interest to propose principled methods of variable selection that can incorporate mandatory covariates. Methods: In this article, we propose the ridge-lasso hybrid estimator (ridle), a new penalized regression method that simultaneously estimates coefficients of mandatory covariates while allowing selection for others. The ridle provides a principled approach to mitigate effects of multicollinearity among the mandatory covariates and possible dependency between mandatory and optional variables. We provide detailed empirical and theoretical studies to evaluate our method. In addition, we develop an efficient algorithm for the ridle. Software, based on efficient Fortran code with R-language wrappers, is publicly and freely available at https://sites.google.com/site/zhongyindaye/software. Results: The ridle is useful when mandatory predictors are known to be significant due to prior knowledge or must be kept for additional analysis. Both theoretical and comprehensive simulation studies have shown that the ridle to be advantageous when mandatory covariates are correlated with the irrelevant optional predictors or are highly correlated among themselves. A microarray gene expression analysis of the histologic grades of breast cancer has identified 24 genes, in which 2 genes are selected only by the ridle among current methods and found to be associated with tumor grade. Conclusions: In this article, we proposed the ridle as a principled sparse regression method for the selection of optional variables while incorporating mandatory ones. Results suggest that the ridle is advantageous when mandatory covariates are correlated with the irrelevant optional predictors or are highly correlated among themselves.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Loss of immune function and an increased incidence of myeloid leukemia are two of the most clinically significant consequences of aging of the hematopoietic system. To better understand the mechanisms underlying hematopoietic aging, we evaluated the cell intrinsic functional and molecular properties of highly purified long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) from young and old mice. We found that LT-HSC aging was accompanied by cell autonomous changes, including increased stem cell self-renewal, differential capacity to generate committed myeloid and lymphoid progenitors, and diminished lymphoid potential. Expression pro-filing revealed that LT-HSC aging was accompanied by the systemic down-regulation of genes mediating lymphoid specification and function and up-regulation of genes involved in specifying myeloid fate and function. Moreover, LT-HSCs from old mice expressed elevated levels of many genes involved in leukemic transfor-mation. These data support a model in which age-dependent alterations in gene expression at the stem cell level presage downstream developmental potential and thereby contribute to age-dependent immune decline, and perhaps also to the increased incidence of leukemia in the elderly.},

Herein, we typed over 450,000 CpG sites in whole blood of 573 individuals of diverse Hispanic origin who also had high-density genotype data. We found that both self-identified ethnicity and genetically determined ancestry were each significantly associated with methylation levels at 916 and 194 CpGs, respectively, and that shared genomic ancestry accounted for a median of 75.7{\%} (IQR 45.8{\%} to 92{\%}) of the variance in methylation associated with ethnicity. There was a significant enrichment (p=4.2×10-64) of ethnicity-associated sites amongst loci previously associated environmental exposures, particularly maternal smoking during pregnancy. We conclude that differential methylation between ethnic groups is partially explained by the shared genetic ancestry but that environmental factors not captured by ancestry significantly contribute to variation in methylation.},

A prior study of aging yeast mother cells showed a progressive enlargement and fragmentation of the nucleolus. Here we show that these nucleolar changes are likely due to the accumulation of extrachromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs) in old cells and that, in fact, ERCs cause aging. Mutants for sgs1, the yeast homolog of the Werner's syndrome gene, accumulate ERCs more rapidly, leading to premature aging and a shorter life span. We speculate on the generality of this molecular cause of aging in higher species, including mammals.},

abstract = {Overexpression of sirtuins (NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylases) has been reported to increase lifespan in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. Studies of the effects of genes on ageing are vulnerable to confounding effects of genetic background. Here we re-examined the reported effects of sirtuin overexpression on ageing and found that standardization of genetic background and the use of appropriate controls abolished the apparent effects in both C. elegans and Drosophila. In C. elegans, outcrossing of a line with high-level sir-2.1 overexpression abrogated the longevity increase, but did not abrogate sir-2.1 overexpression. Instead, longevity co-segregated with a second-site mutation affecting sensory neurons. Outcrossing of a line with low-copy-number sir-2.1 overexpression also abrogated longevity. A Drosophila strain with ubiquitous overexpression of dSir2 using the UAS-GAL4 system was long-lived relative to wild-type controls, as previously reported, but was not long-lived relative to the appropriate transgenic controls, and nor was a new line with stronger overexpression of dSir2. These findings underscore the importance of controlling for genetic background and for the mutagenic effects of transgene insertions in studies of genetic effects on lifespan. The life-extending effect of dietary restriction on ageing in Drosophila has also been reported to be dSir2 dependent. We found that dietary restriction increased fly lifespan independently of dSir2. Our findings do not rule out a role for sirtuins in determination of metazoan lifespan, but they do cast doubt on the robustness of the previously reported effects of sirtuins on lifespan in C. elegans and Drosophila.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide slows bone remodeling and bone loss in animals. Because nitroglycerin and other nitrates increase nitric oxide levels, we hypothesized that nitrate use may be associated with greater bone mineral density (BMD) and decreased risk of fracture in humans. Further, intermittent nitrate use may be associated with greater benefits than daily nitrate use, which results in tachyphylaxis. We tested this hypothesis using data from the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures. We prospectively studied 6201 elderly women of whom 317 took nitrates on a daily basis and 74 used them intermittently. We measured BMD at the hip and the heel and adjusted all comparisons for multiple potential confounders. We found that women taking daily nitrates had slightly greater hip BMD (difference, 13{\%}; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.14-4.1{\%}) but the same heel BMD (difference, 0{\%}; 95{\%} CI -2.6-2.6{\%}) as nonusers. By contrast, women using nitrates intermittently had substantially greater hip (difference, 2.6{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 0.4-6.8{\%}) and heel BMD (difference, 53{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 2.6-11{\%}) than nonusers. This study suggests that the intermittent administration of nitrates may enhance BMD.},

abstract = {Somatic mutations acquired in healthy tissues as we age are major determinants of cancer risk. Whether variants confer a fitness advantage or rise to detectable frequencies by chance, however, remains largely unknown. Here, by combining blood sequencing data from {\~{}}50,000 individuals, we reveal how mutation, genetic drift and fitness differences combine to shape the genetic diversity of healthy blood ('clonal haematopoiesis'). By analysing the spectrum of variant allele frequencies we quantify fitness advantages for key pathogenic variants and genes and provide bounds on the number of haematopoietic stem cells. Positive selection, not drift, is the major force shaping clonal haematopoiesis. The remarkably wide variation in variant allele frequencies observed across individuals is driven by chance differences in the timing of mutation acquisition combined with differences in the cell-intrinsic fitness effect of variants. Contrary to the widely held view that clonal haematopoiesis is driven by ageing-related alterations in the stem cell niche, the data are consistent with the age dependence being driven simply by continuing risk of mutations and subsequent clonal expansions that lead to increased detectability at older ages.},

abstract = {Intra-sample cellular heterogeneity presents numerous challenges to the identification of biomarkers in large Epigenome-Wide Association Studies (EWAS). While a number of reference-based deconvolution algorithms have emerged, their potential remains underexplored and a comparative evaluation of these algorithms beyond tissues such as blood is still lacking. Here we present a novel framework for reference-based inference, which leverages cell-type specific DNAse Hypersensitive Site (DHS) information from the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap to construct an improved reference DNA methylation database. We show that this leads to a marginal but statistically significant improvement of cell-count estimates in whole blood as well as in mixtures involving epithelial cell-types. Using this framework we compare a widely used state-of-the-art reference-based algorithm (called constrained projection) to two non-constrained approaches including CIBERSORT and a method based on robust partial correlations. We conclude that the widely-used constrained projection technique may not always be optimal. Instead, we find that the method based on robust partial correlations is generally more robust across a range of different tissue types and for realistic noise levels. We call the combined algorithm which uses DHS data and robust partial correlations for inference, EpiDISH (Epigenetic Dissection of Intra-Sample Heterogeneity). Finally, we demonstrate the added value of EpiDISH in an EWAS of smoking. Estimating cell-type fractions and subsequent inference in EWAS may benefit from the use of non-constrained reference-based cell-type deconvolution methods.},

abstract = {Phospholipids containing highly polyunsaturated fatty acids are particularly prone to peroxidation and membrane composition may therefore influence longevity. Phospholipid molecules, in particular those containing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), from the skeletal muscle, heart, liver and liver mitochondria were identified and quantified using mass-spectrometry shotgun lipidomics in two similar-sized rodents that show an approximately 9-fold difference in maximum lifespan. The naked mole rat is the longest-living rodent known with a maximum lifespan of {\textgreater}28 years. Total phospholipid distribution is similar in tissues of both species; DHA is only found in phosphatidylcholines (PC), phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) and phosphatidylserines (PS), and DHA is relatively more concentrated in PE than PC. Naked mole-rats have fewer molecular species of both PC and PE than do mice. DHA-containing phospholipids represent 27-57{\%} of all phospholipids in mice but only 2-6{\%} in naked mole-rats. Furthermore, while mice have small amounts of di-polyunsaturated PC and PE, these are lacking in naked mole-rats. Vinyl ether-linked phospholipids (plasmalogens) are higher in naked mole-rat tissues than in mice. The lower level of DHA-containing phospholipids suggests a lower susceptibility to peroxidative damage in membranes of naked mole-rats compared to mice. Whereas the high level of plasmalogens might enhance membrane antioxidant protection in naked mole-rats compared to mice. Both characteristics possibly contribute to the exceptional longevity of naked mole-rats and may indicate a special role for peroxisomes in this extended longevity.},

abstract = {We have addressed the relative importance of peak bone mass and subsequent rate of loss in determining postmenopausal women's bone mass in old age, by examining longitudinal measurements of radial mid-shaft bone mass on various samples of healthy white postmenopausal women. Using both the variance estimate of age-specific rates of bone loss and the population variance in bone mass, we determined that rates of loss could contribute importantly to future bone mass. However, since we found a small negative correlation between initial bone mass and rate of loss, it was necessary to estimate the effect of bone loss as the complement of the contribution of initial bone mass. We found that the influence of bone loss (relative to initial bone mass) increases as the women age, such that by about age 70, the contribution of initial bone mass and rate of loss approached equality. However, estimated rates of bone loss were not very stable over time, so it was difficult to identify long-term 'fast-losers'. We conclude that the rate of postmenopausal bone loss is an important contributor to osteoporosis at old age, but it is difficult to identify long-term fast-losers, thereby reducing the clinical value of assessments of rates of change in bone mass early in the postmenopause. {\textcopyright} 1990 European Foundation for Osteoporosis.},

Furthermore, we interrogated the AluJb-LIN28B candidate: the genetic deletion of the TE eliminated oncogene expression, while dynamic DNA methylation modulated promoter activity, illustrating the necessity and sufficiency of a TE for oncogene activation. Collectively, our results characterize the global profile of TE onco-exaptation and highlight this prevalent phenomenon as an important mechanism for promiscuous oncogene activation and ultimately tumorigenesis.},

abstract = {Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) can grow in environments with significantly elevated osmolarities, such as murine and human urinary tracts. OmpR is the response regulator part of a two-component OmpR-EnvZ regulatory system that responds to osmotic stresses. To determine the role of OmpR in UPEC survival, a DeltaompR mutant was created in the UPEC clinical isolate NU149. The DeltaompR mutant had a growth defect compared with the wild-type strain under osmotic stress conditions; this defect was complemented by the full-length ompR gene on a plasmid, but not with a mutant OmpR with an alanine substitution for aspartic acid at the phosphorylation site at position 55. Furthermore, the DeltaompR mutant displayed up to 2-log reduction in bacterial cell numbers in murine bladders and kidneys compared with wild-type bacteria after 5 days of infection. The ability of the bacteria to survive was restored to wild-type levels when the DeltaompR mutant strain was complemented with wild-type ompR, but not when the alanine-substituted ompR gene was used. This study has fulfilled molecular Koch's postulates by showing the pivotal role OmpR plays in UPEC survival within the murine urinary tract.},

abstract = {Background: High-resolution genome-wide measurement of DNA methylation (DNAm) has become a widely used assay in biomedical research. A major challenge in measuring DNAm is variability introduced from intra-sample cellular heterogeneity, which is a convolution of DNAm profiles across cell types. When this source of variability is confounded with an outcome of interest, if unaccounted for, false positives ensue. This is particularly problematic in epigenome-wide association studies for human disease performed on whole blood, a heterogeneous tissue. To account for this source of variability, a first step is to determine the actual cell proportions of each sample. Currently, the most effective approach is based on fitting a linear model in which one assumes the DNAm profiles of the representative cell types are known. However, we can only make this assumption when a dedicated experiment is performed to provide a plug-in estimate for these profiles. Although this method works well in practice, technology-specific biases lead to platform-dependent plug-in profiles. As a result, to apply the current methods across technologies we are required to repeat these costly experiments for each platform. Results: Here, we present a method that accurately estimates cell proportions agnostic to platform by first using experimental data to identify regions in which each cell type is clearly methylated or unmethlyated and model these as latent states. While the continuous measurements used in the linear model approaches are affected by platform-specific biases, the latent states are biologically driven and therefore technology independent, implying that experimental data only needs to be collected once. We demonstrate that our method accurately estimates the cell composition from whole blood samples and is applicable across multiple platforms, including microarray and sequencing platforms.},

Demographic evidence has revealed an ongoing reduction in old-age mortality and a rise of the maximum age at death, which may gradually extend human longevity. Together with observations that lifespan in various animal species is flexible and can be increased by genetic or pharmaceutical intervention, these results have led to suggestions that longevity may not be subject to strict, species-specific genetic constraints. Here, by analysing global demographic data, we show that improvements in survival with age tend to decline after age 100, and that the age at death of the world's oldest person has not increased since the 1990s. Our results strongly suggest that the maximum lifespan of humans is fixed and subject to natural constraints.},

In the structure, two amino-terminal domains of the sigma subunit form a V-shaped structure near the opening of the upstream DNA-binding channel of the active site cleft. The carboxy-terminal domain of sigma is near the outlet of the RNA-exit channel, about 57 A from the N-terminal domains. The extended linker domain forms a hairpin protruding into the active site cleft, then stretching through the RNA-exit channel to connect the N- and C-terminal domains.

Following infection of CV-1 cells by the recombinant virus stocks, both the wild type and mutant tRNAs are produced in large quantities during a 48-h period. Fingerprint analysis of 32P-labeled tRNAs was used to characterize the tRNAs made in vivo and to show that the sequence AUCG in loop IV of the wild type tRNA is replaced by T psi CG in the mutant tRNA. Modified nucleotide composition analysis of the [32P]tRNAs overproduced in vivo shows that they contain all the modified nucleotides found in human placenta initiator tRNA.

abstract = {The DAF-2 insulin/IGF-1 receptor regulates development, metabolism, and aging in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. However, complex differences among daf-2 alleles complicate analysis of this gene. We have employed epistasis analysis, transcript profile analysis, mutant sequence analysis, and homology modeling of mutant receptors to understand this complexity. We define an allelic series of nonconditional daf-2 mutants, including nonsense and deletion alleles, and a putative null allele, m65. The most severe daf-2 alleles show incomplete suppression by daf-18(0) and daf-16(0) and have a range of effects on early development. Among weaker daf-2 alleles there exist distinct mutant classes that differ in epistatic interactions with mutations in other genes. Mutant sequence analysis (including 11 newly sequenced alleles) reveals that class 1 mutant lesions lie only in certain extracellular regions of the receptor, while class 2 (pleiotropic) and nonconditional missense mutants have lesions only in the ligand-binding pocket of the receptor ectodomain or the tyrosine kinase domain. Effects of equivalent mutations on the human insulin receptor suggest an altered balance of intracellular signaling in class 2 alleles. These studies consolidate and extend our understanding of the complex genetics of daf-2 and its underlying molecular biology.},

By mapping Pol III occupancy genome-wide in mouse, rat, human, macaque, dog and opossum livers, we found that Pol III binding to individual tRNA genes varies substantially in strength and location. However, when we took into account tRNA redundancies by grouping Pol III occupancy into 46 anticodon isoacceptor families or 21 amino acid-based isotype classes, we discovered strong conservation. Similarly, Pol III occupancy of amino acid isotypes is almost invariant among transcriptionally and evolutionarily diverse tissues in mouse. Thus, synthesis of functional tRNA isotypes has been highly constrained, although the usage of individual tRNA genes has evolved rapidly.},

Existing strategies for masking Infinium probes overlapping repeats or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are based largely on ad hoc assumptions and subjective criteria. In addition, the recently introduced MethylationEPIC (EPIC) array expands on the utility of this platform, but has not yet been well characterized. We present in this paper an extensive characterization of probes on the EPIC and HM450 microarrays, including mappability to the latest genome build, genomic copy number of the 3΄ nested subsequence and influence of polymorphisms including a previously unrecognized color channel switch for Type I probes. We show empirical evidence for exclusion criteria for underperforming probes, providing a sounder basis than current ad hoc criteria for exclusion. In addition, we describe novel probe uses, exemplified by the addition of a total of 1052 SNP probes to the existing 59 explicit SNP probes on the EPIC array and the use of these probes to predict ethnicity. Finally, we present an innovative out-of-band color channel application for the dual use of 62 371 probes as internal bisulfite conversion controls.},

abstract = {It has been postulated that imprinting aberrations are common in tumors. To understand the role of imprinting in cancer, we have characterized copy-number and methylation in over 280 cancer cell lines and confirm our observations in primary tumors. Imprinted differentially methylated regions (DMRs) regulate parent-of-origin monoallelic expression of neighboring transcripts in cis. Unlike single-copy CpG islands that may be prone to hypermethylation, imprinted DMRs can either loose or gain methylation during tumorigenesis. Here, we show that methylation profiles at imprinted DMRs often not represent genuine epigenetic changes but simply the accumulation of underlying copy-number aberrations (CNAs), which is independent of the genome methylation state inferred from cancer susceptible loci. Our results reveal that CNAs also influence allelic expression as loci with copy-number neutral loss-of-heterozygosity or amplifications may be expressed from the appropriate parental chromosomes, which is indicative of maintained imprinting, although not observed as a single expression foci by RNA FISH.Altered genomic imprinting is frequently reported in cancer. Here, the authors analyze copy number and methylation in cancer cell lines and primary tumors to show that imprinted methylation profiles represent the accumulation of copy number alteration, rather than epigenetic alterations.},

To address these issues, we developed hydro-tRNAseq, a method based on partial alkaline RNA hydrolysis that generates fragments amenable for sequencing. To identify transcribed tRNA genes, we further complemented this approach with photoactivatable crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) of SSB/La, a conserved protein involved in pre-tRNA processing. Our results show that approximately half of all predicted tRNA genes are transcribed in human cells. We also report nucleotide modification sites and their order of introduction, and we identify tRNA leaders, trailers, and introns. By using complementary sequencing-based methodologies, we present a human tRNA atlas and determine expression levels of mature and processing intermediates of tRNAs in human cells.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The context of the start codon (typically, AUG) and the features of the 5' Untranslated Regions (5' UTRs) are important for understanding translation regulation in eukaryotic mRNAs and for accurate prediction of the coding region in genomic and cDNA sequences. The presence of AUG triplets in 5' UTRs (upstream AUGs) might effect the initiation rate and, in the context of gene prediction, could reduce the accuracy of the identification of the authentic start. To reveal potential connections between the presence of upstream AUGs and other features of 5' UTRs, such as their length and the start codon context, we undertook a systematic analysis of the available eukaryotic 5' UTR sequences. RESULTS: We show that a large fraction of 5' UTRs in the available cDNA sequences, 15-53{\%} depending on the organism, contain upstream ATGs. A negative correlation was observed between the information content of the translation start signal and the length of the 5' UTR. Similarly, a negative correlation exists between the 'strength' of the start context and the number of upstream ATGs. Typically, cDNAs containing long 5' UTRs with multiple upstream ATGs have a 'weak' start context, and in contrast, cDNAs containing short 5' UTRs without ATGs have 'strong' starts. These counter-intuitive results may be interpreted in terms of upstream AUGs having an important role in the regulation of translation efficiency by ensuring low basal translation level via double negative control and creating the potential for additional regulatory mechanisms. One of such mechanisms, supported by experimental studies of some mRNAs, includes removal of the AUG-containing portion of the 5' UTR by alternative splicing.

abstract = {Introns can be extraordinarily large and they account for the majority of the DNA sequence in human genes. However, little is known about their population patterns of structural variation and their functional implication. By combining the most extensive maps of CNVs in human populations, we have found that intronic losses are the most frequent copy number variants (CNVs) in protein-coding genes in human, with 12,986 intronic deletions, affecting 4,147 genes (including 1,154 essential genes and 1,638 disease-related genes). This intronic length variation results in dozens of genes showing extreme population variability in size, with 40 genes with 10 or more different sizes and up to 150 allelic sizes. Intronic losses are frequent in evolutionarily ancient genes that are highly conserved at the protein sequence level. This result contrasts with losses overlapping exons, which are observed less often than expected by chance and almost exclusively affect primate-specific genes. An integrated analysis of CNVs and RNA-seq data showed that intronic loss can be associated with significant differences in gene expression levels in the population (CNV-eQTLs). These intronic CNV-eQTLs regions are enriched for intronic enhancers and can be associated with expression differences of other genes showing long distance intron-promoter 3D interactions. Our data suggests that intronic structural variation of protein-coding genes makes an important contribution to the variability of gene expression and splicing in human populations.},

Here we report a genome-wide characterization of sRNAs in M. tuberculosis integrating experimental and computational analyses. Global RNA-seq analysis of exponentially growing cultures of M. tuberculosis H37Rv had previously identified 1373 sRNA species. In the present report we show that 258 (19{\%}) of these were also identified by microarray expression. This set included 22 intergenic sRNAs, 84 sRNAs mapping within 5'/3' UTRs, and 152 antisense sRNAs. Analysis of promoter and terminator consensus sequences identified sigma A promoter consensus sequences for 121 sRNAs (47{\%}), terminator consensus motifs for 22 sRNAs (8.5{\%}), and both motifs for 35 sRNAs (14{\%}). Additionally, 20/23 candidates were visualized by Northern blot analysis and 5' end mapping by primer extension confirmed the RNA-seq data. We also used a computational approach utilizing functional enrichment to identify the pathways targeted by sRNA regulation. We found that antisense sRNAs preferentially regulated transcription of membrane-bound proteins. Genes putatively regulated by novel cis-encoded sRNAs were enriched for two-component systems and for functional pathways involved in hydrogen transport on the membrane.},

abstract = {Establishing causal relationships between environmental exposures and common diseases is beset with problems of unresolved confounding, reverse causation and selection bias that may result in spurious inferences. Mendelian randomization, in which a functional genetic variant acts as a proxy for an environmental exposure, provides a means of overcoming these problems as the inheritance of genetic variants is independent of-that is randomized with respect to-the inheritance of other traits, according to Mendel's law of independent assortment. Examples drawn from exposures and outcomes as diverse as milk and osteoporosis, alcohol and coronary heart disease, sheep dip and farm workers' compensation neurosis, folate and neural tube defects are used to illustrate the applications of Mendelian randomization approaches in assessing potential environmental causes of disease. As with all genetic epidemiology studies there are problems associated with the need for large sample sizes, the non-replication of findings, and the lack of relevant functional genetic variants. In addition to these problems, Mendelian randomization findings may be confounded by other genetic variants in linkage disequilibrium with the variant under study, or by population stratification. Furthermore, pleiotropy of effect of a genetic variant may result in null associations, as may canalisation of genetic effects. If correctly conducted and carefully interpreted, Mendelian randomization studies can provide useful evidence to support or reject causal hypotheses linking environmental exposures to common diseases.},

abstract = {Targeting of membrane proteins to their proper destination requires specific mechanisms. Protein cargos are included in vesicles that bud off a donor organelle and ultimately fuse with a target organelle, where the cargos are delivered. Endocytosis of transmembrane receptors (e.g., receptor tyrosine kinases, RTKs) follows a common scheme that consists of an internalization reaction and a delivery step, during which cargos are transferred to an endosomal station to be either directed to the lysosome for degradation or recycled back to the cell surface. At each stage along the endocytic route, short motifs within protein cargos and/or post-translational modifications regulate transmembrane receptor sorting. In recent years, studies have shown that ubiquitination acts as a signal for the internalization and sorting of plasma membrane proteins. Here, we present an overview of ubiquitin's role as a 'signal' for intracellular trafficking and give examples of the multifaced mechanisms of ubiquitin-regulated RTK endocytosis.},

abstract = {Ageing in diverse species ranging from yeast to humans is associated with the gradual, lifelong accumulation of molecular and cellular damage. Autophagy, a conserved lysosomal, self-destructive process involved in protein and organelle degradation, plays an essential role in both cellular and whole-animal homeostasis. Accumulating evidence now indicates that autophagic degradation declines with age and this gradual reduction of autophagy might have a causative role in the functional deterioration of biological systems during ageing. Indeed, loss of autophagy gene function significantly influences longevity. Moreover, genetic or pharmacological manipulations that extend lifespan in model organisms often activate autophagy. Interestingly, conserved signalling pathways and environmental factors that regulate ageing, such as the insulin/IGF-1 signalling pathway and oxidative stress response pathways converge on autophagy. In this article, we survey recent findings in invertebrates that contribute to advance our understanding of the molecular links between autophagy and the regulation of ageing. In addition, we consider related mechanisms in other organisms and discuss their similarities and idiosyncratic features in a comparative manner.},

The Atg8-PE conjugate is essential for autophagy, which is the bulk degradation process of cytoplasmic components by the vacuolar/lysosomal system. We report here the crystal structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Atg3 at 2.5-A resolution. Atg3 has an alpha/beta-fold, and its core region is topologically similar to canonical E2 enzymes. Atg3 has two regions inserted in the core region, one of which consists of approximately 80 residues and has a random coil structure in solution and another with a long alpha-helical structure that protrudes from the core region as far as 30 A. In vivo and in vitro analyses suggested that the former region is responsible for binding Atg7, an E1-like enzyme, and that the latter is responsible for binding Atg8. A sulfate ion was bound near the catalytic cysteine of Atg3, suggesting a possible binding site for the phosphate moiety of PE. The structure of Atg3 provides a molecular basis for understanding the unique lipidation reaction that Atg3 carries out.},

abstract = {Of the ∼ 1.3 million Alu elements in the human genome, only a tiny number are estimated to be active in transcription by RNA polymerase (Pol) III. Tracing the individual loci from which Alu transcripts originate is complicated by their highly repetitive nature. By exploiting RNA-Seq data sets and unique Alu DNA sequences, we devised a bioinformatic pipeline allowing us to identify Pol III-dependent transcripts of individual Alu elements. When applied to ENCODE transcriptomes of seven human cell lines, this search strategy identified ∼ 1300 Alu loci corresponding to detectable transcripts, with ∼ 120 of them expressed in at least three cell lines. In vitro transcription of selected Alus did not reflect their in vivo expression properties, and required the native 5'-flanking region in addition to internal promoter. We also identified a cluster of expressed AluYa5-derived transcription units, juxtaposed to snaR genes on chromosome 19, formed by a promoter-containing left monomer fused to an Alu-unrelated downstream moiety. Autonomous Pol III transcription was also revealed for Alus nested within Pol II-transcribed genes. The ability to investigate Alu transcriptomes at single-locus resolution will facilitate both the identification of novel biologically relevant Alu RNAs and the assessment of Alu expression alteration under pathological conditions.},

abstract = {Histones are evolutionarily conserved DNA-binding proteins. As scaffolding molecules, they significantly regulate the DNA packaging into the nucleus of all eukaryotic cells. As docking units, they influence the recruitment of the transcriptional machinery, thus establishing unique gene expression patterns that ultimately promote different biological outcomes. While canonical histones H3.1 and H3.2 are synthetized and loaded during DNA replication, the histone variant H3.3 is expressed and deposited into the chromatin throughout the cell cycle. Recent findings indicate that H3.3 replaces the majority of canonical H3 in non-dividing cells, reaching almost saturation levels in a time-dependent manner. Consequently, H3.3 incorporation and turnover represent an additional layer in the regulation of the chromatin landscape during aging. In this respect, work from our group and others suggest that H3.3 plays an important function in age-related processes throughout evolution. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on H3.3 biology and discuss the implications of its aberrant dynamics in the establishment of cellular states that may lead to human pathology. Critically, we review the importance of H3.3 turnover as part of epigenetic events that influence senescence and age-related processes. We conclude with the emerging evidence that H3.3 is required for proper neuronal function and brain plasticity.},

abstract = {Cellular senescence is a permanent state of cell cycle arrest that occurs in proliferating cells subjected to different stresses. Senescence is, therefore, a cellular defense mechanism that pre-vents the cells to acquire an unnecessary damage. The senescent state is accompanied by a failure to re-enter the cell cycle in response to mitogenic stimuli, an enhanced secretory phenotype and resistance to cell death. Senescence takes place in several tissues during different physiological and pathological processes such as tissue remodeling, injury, cancer, and aging. Although senescence is one of the causative processes of aging and it is responsible of aging-related disorders, senescent cells can also play a positive role. In embryogenesis and tissue remodeling, senescent cells are required for the proper development of the embryo and tissue repair. In cancer, senescence works as a potent barrier to prevent tumorigenesis. Therefore, the identification and characterization of key features of senescence, the induction of senescence in cancer cells, or the elimination of senescent cells by pharmacological interventions in aging tissues is gaining consideration in several fields of research. Here, we describe the known key features of senescence, the cell-autonomous, and noncell-autonomous regulators of senescence, and we attempt to discuss the functional role of this fundamental process in different contexts in light of the development of novel therapeutic targets.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli has two osmo-responsive two-component regulatory systems, the EnvZ-OmpR and KdpD-KdpE systems, each of which consists of a sensor histidine protein kinase and a response regulator. The OmpR and KdpE response regulators belong to the same family of DNA-binding proteins, and act as positive transcriptional factors in response to the medium osmolarity. However, OmpR specifically activates the ompC gene encoding the OmpC outer membrane protein, whereas KdpE exclusively activates the kdpABC operon encoding the high-affinity Kdp potassium-transporter. To gain insight into the molecular basis for such strict promoter selectivity, we isolated OmpR mutants that can activate the non-cognate kdpABC promoter in vivo. For these OmpR mutants, it was found that a few common and crucial amino acids are responsible for the altered property of OmpR (e.g., Gly-164, Glu-193). In vitro properties of these OmpR mutants were further examined by means of DNA-binding assays and DNA-footprinting analyses with reference to the kdpABC promoter. These results were interpreted on the basis of the three-dimensional structure of the C-terminal half of OmpR, which consists of a DNA-binding helix-turn-helix motif and a RNA polymerase-interacting surface. The results of this study were best explained by assuming that the isolated OmpR mutants have an altered property with regard to the interaction with RNA polymerase on the kdpABC promoter. We propose that the promoter selectivity of OmpR is determined not only by its DNA-binding specificity, but also by the spatial configuration of the promoter on which OmpR must properly associate with RNA polymerase.},

abstract = {The OmpR/PhoB family of response regulators (RRs) is the largest class of two-component system signal transduction proteins. Extensive biochemical and structural characterization of these transcription factors has provided insights into their activation and DNA-binding mechanisms. For the most part, OmpR/PhoB family proteins are thought to become activated through phosphorylation from their cognate histidine kinase partners, which in turn facilitates an allosteric change in the RR, enabling homodimerization and subsequently enhanced DNA binding. Incongruently, it has been suggested that OmpR, the eponymous member of this RR family, becomes activated via different mechanisms, whereby DNA binding plays a central role in facilitating dimerization and phosphorylation. Characterization of the rate and extent of the phosphorylation of OmpR and OmpR DNA-binding mutants following activation of the EnvZ/OmpR two-component system shows that DNA binding is not essential for phosphorylation of OmpR in vivo. In addition, detailed analyses of the energetics of DNA binding and dimerization of OmpR in both its unphosphorylated and phosphorylated state indicate that phosphorylation enhances OmpR dimerization and that this dimerization enhancement is the energetic driving force for phosphorylation-mediated regulation of OmpR-DNA binding. These findings suggest that OmpR phosphorylation-mediated activation follows the same paradigm as the other members of the OmpR/PhoB family of RRs in contrast to previously proposed models of OmpR activation.},

abstract = {In mammals, caloric restriction consistently results in extended lifespan. Epigenetic information encoded by DNA methylation is tightly regulated, but shows a striking drift associated with age that includes both gains and losses of DNA methylation at various sites. Here, we report that epigenetic drift is conserved across species and the rate of drift correlates with lifespan when comparing mice, rhesus monkeys, and humans. Twenty-two to 30-year-old rhesus monkeys exposed to 30{\%} caloric restriction since 7–14 years of age showed attenuation of age-related methylation drift compared to ad libitum-fed controls such that their blood methylation age appeared 7 years younger than their chronologic age. Even more pronounced effects were seen in 2.7–3.2-year-old mice exposed to 40{\%} caloric restriction starting at 0.3 years of age. The effects of caloric restriction on DNA methylation were detectable across different tissues and correlated with gene expression. We propose that epigenetic drift is a determinant of lifespan in mammals. Caloric restriction has been shown to increase lifespan in mammals. Here, the authors provide evidence that age-related methylation drift correlates with lifespan and that caloric restriction in mice and rhesus monkeys results in attenuation of age-related methylation drift.},

abstract = {Over the past 75 years, a number of statisticians have advised that the data-analysis method known as null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) should be deprecated (Berkson, 1942; Halsey et al., 2015). The limitations of NHST have been extensively discussed, with an emerging consensus that current statistical practice in the biological sciences needs reform. However, there is less agreement on the specific nature of reform, with vigorous debate surrounding what would constitute a suitable alternative (Altman et al., 2000; Benjamin et al., 2017; Cumming and Calin-Jageman, 2016). An emerging view is that a more complete analytic technique would use statistical graphics to estimate effect sizes and their uncertainty (Cohen, 1994; Cumming and Calin-Jageman, 2016). As these estimation methods require only minimal statistical retraining, they have great potential to change the current data-analysis culture away from dichotomous thinking towards quantitative reasoning (Claridge-Chang and Assam, 2016). The evolution of statistics has been inextricably linked to the development of improved quantitative displays that support complex visual reasoning (Tufte, 2001). We consider that the graphic we describe here as an estimation plot is the most intuitive way to display the complete statistical information about experimental data sets. However, a major obstacle to adopting estimation is accessibility to suitable software. To overcome this hurdle, we have developed free software that makes high-quality estimation plotting available to all. Here, we explain the rationale for estimation plots by contrasting them with conventional charts used to display NHST data, and describe how the use of these graphs affords five major analytical advantages.},

There have now been numerous studies of the potential molecular mediators of epigenetic changes by epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). However, a challenge for the field is the interpretation of the results obtained. We describe a second-generation EWAS approach, which focuses on the possible cellular models of epigenetic perturbations, studied by rigorous analysis and interpretation of genomic data.

abstract = {Aging is a multifactorial process with many mechanisms contributing to the decline. Mutations decreasing insulin/IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1) or TOR (target of rapamycin) kinase-mediated signaling, mitochondrial activity and food intake each extend life span in divergent animal phyla. Understanding how these genetically distinct mechanisms interact to control longevity is a fundamental and fascinating problem in biology. Here we show that mutational inactivation of autophagy genes, which are involved in the degradation of aberrant, damaged cytoplasmic constituents accumulating in all aging cells, accelerates the rate at which the tissues age in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. According to our results Drosophila flies deficient in autophagy are also short-lived. We further demonstrate that reduced activity of autophagy genes suppresses life span extension in mutant nematodes with inherent dietary restriction, aberrant insulin/IGF-1 or TOR signaling, and lowered mitochondrial respiration. These findings suggest that the autophagy gene cascade functions downstream of and is inhibited by different longevity pathways in C. elegans, therefore, their effects converge on autophagy genes to slow down aging and lengthen life span. Thus, autophagy may act as a central regulatory mechanism of animal aging.},

abstract = {We have demonstrated previously that higher birth weight is associated with greater peak and later-life bone mineral content and that maternal body build, diet, and lifestyle influence prenatal bone mineral accrual. To examine prenatal influences on bone health further, we related ultrasound measures of fetal growth to childhood bone size and density. We derived Z-scores for fetal femur length and abdominal circumference and conditional growth velocity from 19 to 34 weeks' gestation from ultrasound measurements in participants in the Southampton Women's Survey. A total of 380 of the offspring underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at age 4 years [whole body minus head bone area (BA), bone mineral content (BMC), areal bone mineral density (aBMD), and estimated volumetric BMD (vBMD)]. Volumetric bone mineral density was estimated using BMC adjusted for BA, height, and weight. A higher velocity of 19- to 34- week fetal femur growth was strongly associated with greater childhood skeletal size (BA: r=0.30, p{\textless}.0001) but not with volumetric density (vBMD: r=0.03, p=.51). Conversely, a higher velocity of 19- to 34-week fetal abdominal growth was associated with greater childhood volumetric density (vBMD: r=0.15, p=.004) but not with skeletal size (BA: r=0.06, p=.21). Both fetal measurements were positively associated with BMC and aBMD, indices influenced by both size and density. The velocity of fetal femur length growth from 19 to 34 weeks' gestation predicted childhood skeletal size at age 4 years, whereas the velocity of abdominal growth (a measure of liver volume and adiposity) predicted volumetric density. These results suggest a discordance between influences on skeletal size and volumetric density. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.},

@article{Horn2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Different proteins are required in widely different quantities to build a living cell. In most organisms, transcription control makes a major contribution to differential expression. This is not the case in trypanosomatids where most genes are transcribed at an equivalent rate within large polycistronic clusters. Thus, trypanosomatids must use post-transcriptional control mechanisms to balance gene expression requirements. RESULTS: Here, the evidence for translational selection, the enrichment of 'favoured' codons in more highly expressed genes, is explored. A set of highly expressed, tandem-repeated genes display codon bias in Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania major. The tRNA complement reveals forty-five of the sixty-one possible anticodons indicating widespread use of 'wobble' tRNAs. Consistent with translational selection, cognate tRNA genes for favoured codons are over-represented. Importantly, codon usage (Codon Adaptation Index) correlates with predicted and observed expression level. In addition, relative codon bias is broadly conserved among syntenic genes from different trypanosomatids. CONCLUSION: Synonymous codon bias is correlated with tRNA gene copy number and with protein expression level in trypanosomatids. Taken together, the results suggest that translational selection is the dominant mechanism underlying the control of differential protein expression in these organisms. The findings reveal how trypanosomatids may compensate for a paucity of canonical Pol II promoters and subsequent widespread constitutive RNA polymerase II transcription.},

abstract = {Aberrant DNA methylation (DNAm) was first linked to cancer over 25 yr ago. Since then, many studies have associated hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and hypomethylation of oncogenes to the tumorigenic process. However, most of these studies have been limited to the analysis of promoters and CpG islands (CGIs). Recently, new technologies for whole-genome DNAm (methylome) analysis have been developed, enabling unbiased analysis of cancer methylomes. By using MeDIP-seq, we report a sequencing-based comparative methylome analysis of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), benign neurofibromas, and normal Schwann cells. Analysis of these methylomes revealed a complex landscape of DNAm alterations. In contrast to what has been reported for other tumor types, no significant global hypomethylation was observed in MPNSTs using methylome analysis by MeDIP-seq. However, a highly significant (P {\textless} 10(-100)) directional difference in DNAm was found in satellite repeats, suggesting these repeats to be the main target for hypomethylation in MPNSTs. Comparative analysis of the MPNST and Schwann cell methylomes identified 101,466 cancer-associated differentially methylated regions (cDMRs). Analysis showed these cDMRs to be significantly enriched for two satellite repeat types (SATR1 and ARL$\alpha$) and suggests an association between aberrant DNAm of these sequences and transition from healthy cells to malignant disease. Significant enrichment of hypermethylated cDMRs in CGI shores (P {\textless} 10(-60)), non-CGI-associated promoters (P {\textless} 10(-4)) and hypomethylated cDMRs in SINE repeats (P {\textless} 10(-100)) was also identified. Integration of DNAm and gene expression data showed that the expression pattern of genes associated with CGI shore cDMRs was able to discriminate between disease phenotypes. This study establishes MeDIP-seq as an effective method to analyze cancer methylomes.},

This is problematic, as many different data distributions can lead to the same bar or line graph. The full data may suggest different conclusions from the summary statistics. We recommend training investigators in data presentation, encouraging a more complete presentation of data, and changing journal editorial policies.

We present here a hierarchical modular cloning system that allows the creation at will and with high efficiency of any eukaryotic multigene construct, starting from libraries of defined and validated basic modules containing regulatory and coding sequences. This system is based on the ability of type IIS restriction enzymes to assemble multiple DNA fragments in a defined linear order. We constructed a 33 kb DNA molecule containing 11 transcription units made from 44 individual basic modules in only three successive cloning steps. This modular cloning (MoClo) system can be readily automated and will be extremely useful for applications such as gene stacking and metabolic engineering.},

abstract = {The degree to which codon usage can be explained by tRNA abundance in bacterial species is often inadequate, partly because differential tRNA abundance is often approximated by tRNA copy numbers. To better understand the coevolution between tRNA abundance and codon usage, we provide a better estimate of tRNA abundance by profiling tRNA mapped reads (tRNA tpm) using publicly available RNA Sequencing data. To emphasize the feasibility of our approach, we demonstrate that tRNA tpm is consistent with tRNA abundances derived from RNA fingerprinting experiments in Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Salmonella enterica. Furthermore, we do not observe an appreciable reduction in tRNA sequencing efficiency due to post-transcriptional methylations in the seven bacteria studied. To determine optimal codons, we calculate codon usage in highly and lowly expressed genes determined by protein per transcript. We found that tRNA tpm is sensitive to identify more translationally optimal codons than gene copy number and early tRNA fingerprinting abundances. Additionally, tRNA tpm improves the predictive power of tRNA adaptation index over codon preference. Our results suggest that dependence of codon usage on tRNA availability is not always associated with species growth-rate. Conversely, tRNA availability is better optimized to codon usage in fast-growing than slow-growing species.},

Here we show that transcriptional profiling of the human frontal cortex from individuals ranging from 26 to 106 years of age defines a set of genes with reduced expression after age 40. These genes play central roles in synaptic plasticity, vesicular transport and mitochondrial function. This is followed by induction of stress response, antioxidant and DNA repair genes. DNA damage is markedly increased in the promoters of genes with reduced expression in the aged cortex. Moreover, these gene promoters are selectively damaged by oxidative stress in cultured human neurons, and show reduced base-excision DNA repair. Thus, DNA damage may reduce the expression of selectively vulnerable genes involved in learning, memory and neuronal survival, initiating a programme of brain ageing that starts early in adult life.},

abstract = {Bdellovibrio and like organisms are obligate predators of bacteria that are ubiquitously found in the environment. Most exhibit a peculiar dimorphic life cycle during which free-swimming attack-phase (AP) cells search for and invade bacterial prey cells. The invader develops in the prey as a filamentous polynucleoid-containing cell that finally splits into progeny cells. Therapeutic and biocontrol applications of Bdellovibrio in human and animal health and plant health, respectively, have been proposed, but more knowledge of this peculiar cell cycle is needed to develop such applications. A proteomic approach was applied to study cell cycle-dependent expression of the Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus proteome in synchronous cultures of a facultative host-independent (HI) strain able to grow in the absence of prey. Results from two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and temporal expression of selected genes in predicted operons were analyzed. In total, about 21{\%} of the in silico predicted proteome was covered. One hundred ninety-six proteins were identified, including 63 hitherto unknown proteins and 140 life stage-dependent spots. Of those, 47 were differentially expressed, including chemotaxis, attachment, growth- and replication-related, cell wall, and regulatory proteins. Novel cell cycle-dependent adhesion, gliding, mechanosensing, signaling, and hydrolytic functions were assigned. The HI model was further studied by comparing HI and wild-type AP cells, revealing that proteins involved in DNA replication and signaling were deregulated in the former. A complementary analysis of the secreted proteome identified 59 polypeptides, including cell contact proteins and hydrolytic enzymes specific to predatory bacteria.},

If an aging-related decline in the AMPK sensitivity to cellular stress is a crucial event for mTOR-driven aging and aging-related diseases, including cancer, unraveling new proximal causes through which AMPK activation endows its gerosuppressive effects may offer not only a better understanding of metformin function but also the likely possibility of repositioning our existing gerosuppressant drugs. Here we provide our perspective on recent findings suggesting that de novo biosynthesis of purine nucleotides, which is based on the metabolism of one-carbon compounds, is a new target for metformin's actions at the crossroads of aging and cancer.},

Replicative polymerases are the main guardian responsible for high replication fidelity of genomic DNA. DNA main replicative polymerases are also involved in many DNA repair processes. High fidelity of DNA replication is determined by correct nucleotide selectivity in polymerase active center, and exonucleolytic proofreading that removes mismatches from primer terminus. In this article we will focus on the mechanisms that are responsible for high fidelity of replications with the special emphasis on structural studies showing important conformational changes after substrate binding. We will also stress the importance of hydrogen bonding, base pair geometry, polymerase DNA interactions and the role of accessory proteins in replication fidelity.},

abstract = {Induction of an altered phenotype by prenatal under-nutrition involves changes in the epigenetic regulation of specific genes. We investigated the effect of feeding pregnant rats a protein-restricted (PR) diet with different amounts of folic acid on the methylation of individual CpG dinucleotides in the hepatic PPAR$\alpha$ promoter in juvenile offspring, and the effect of the maternal PR diet on CpG methylation in adult offspring. Pregnant rats (five per group) were fed 180 g/kg casein (control) or 90 g/kg casein with 1 mg/kg folic acid (PR), or 90 g/kg casein and 5 mg/kg folic acid (PRF). Offspring were killed on postnatal day 34 (five males and females per group) and day 80 (five males per group). Methylation of sixteen CpG dinucleotides in the PPAR$\alpha$ promoter was measured by pyrosequencing. Mean PPAR$\alpha$ promoter methylation in the PR offspring (4{\textperiodcentered}5 {\%}) was 26 {\%} lower than controls (6{\textperiodcentered}1 {\%}) due to specific reduction at CpG dinucleotides 2 (40 {\%}), 3 (43 {\%}), 4 (33 {\%}) and 16 (48 {\%}) ( P {\textless} 0{\textperiodcentered}05). There was no significant difference in methylation at these CpG between control and PRF offspring. Methylation of CpG 5 and 8 was higher (47 and 63 {\%}, respectively, P {\textless} 0{\textperiodcentered}05) in the PRF offspring than control or PR offspring. The methylation pattern in day 80 PR offspring was comparable to day 34 PR offspring. These data show for the first time that prenatal nutrition induces differential changes to the methylation of individual CpG dinucleotides in juvenile rats which persist in adults.},

abstract = {N6-Methyladenosine is a ubiquitous modification identified in the mRNA of numerous eukaryotes, where it is present within both coding and noncoding regions. However, this base modification does not alter the coding capacity, and its biological significance remains unclear. We show that Arabidopsis thaliana mRNA contains N6-methyladenosine at levels similar to those previously reported for animal cells. We further show that inactivation of the Arabidopsis ortholog of the yeast and human mRNA adenosine methylase (MTA) results in failure of the developing embryo to progress past the globular stage. We also demonstrate that the arrested seeds are deficient in mRNAs containing N6-methyladenosine. Expression of MTA is strongly associated with dividing tissues, particularly reproductive organs, shoot meristems, and emerging lateral roots. Finally, we show that MTA interacts in vitro and in vivo with At FIP37, a homolog of the Drosophila protein FEMALE LETHAL2D and of human WILMS' TUMOUR1-ASSOCIATING PROTEIN. The results reported here provide direct evidence for an essential function for N6-methyladenosine in a multicellular eukaryote, and the interaction with At FIP37 suggests possible RNA processing events that might be regulated or altered by this base modification.},

Here by analysing human cancer genomes we identify mutational patterns associated with aging. Our analyses suggest that age-associated mutation load and burden double approximately every 8 years, similar to the all-cause mortality doubling time. This analysis further reveals variance in the rate of aging among different human tissues, for example, slightly accelerated aging of the reproductive system. Age-adjusted mutation load and burden correlate with the corresponding cancer incidence and precede it on average by 15 years, pointing to pre-clinical cancer development times. Behaviour of mutation load also exhibits gender differences and late-life reversals, explaining some gender-specific and late-life patterns in cancer incidence rates. Overall, this study characterizes some features of human aging and offers a mechanism for age being a risk factor for the onset of cancer.},

A two-group (intervention versus control) longitudinal design was used to determine whether GIR leads to better HRQOL in these individuals and whether improvement in HRQOL could be attributed to intervention-associated improvements in pain and mobility. Twenty-eight women were randomized to either the GIR intervention or the control intervention group.

Integration of tandem Brainbow copies in transgenic mice yielded combinatorial XFP expression, and thus many colours, thereby providing a way to distinguish adjacent neurons and visualize other cellular interactions. As a demonstration, we reconstructed hundreds of neighbouring axons and multiple synaptic contacts in one small volume of a cerebellar lobe exhibiting approximately 90 colours. The expression in some lines also allowed us to map glial territories and follow glial cells and neurons over time in vivo. The ability of the Brainbow system to label uniquely many individual cells within a population may facilitate the analysis of neuronal circuitry on a large scale.},

abstract = {ALKBH5 is a 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and ferrous iron-dependent nucleic acid oxygenase (NAOX) that catalyzes the demethylation of N(6)-methyladenine in RNA. ALKBH5 is upregulated under hypoxia and plays a role in spermatogenesis. We describe a crystal structure of human ALKBH5 (residues 66-292) to 2.0 {\AA} resolution. ALKBH5₆₆₋₂₉₂ has a double-stranded $\beta$-helix core fold as observed in other 2OG and iron-dependent oxygenase family members. The active site metal is octahedrally coordinated by an HXD{\ldots}H motif (comprising residues His204, Asp206 and His266) and three water molecules. ALKBH5 shares a nucleotide recognition lid and conserved active site residues with other NAOXs. A large loop ($\beta$IV-V) in ALKBH5 occupies a similar region as the L1 loop of the fat mass and obesity-associated protein that is proposed to confer single-stranded RNA selectivity. Unexpectedly, a small molecule inhibitor, IOX3, was observed covalently attached to the side chain of Cys200 located outside of the active site. Modelling substrate into the active site based on other NAOX-nucleic acid complexes reveals conserved residues important for recognition and demethylation mechanisms. The structural insights will aid in the development of inhibitors selective for NAOXs, for use as functional probes and for therapeutic benefit.},

abstract = {Motivation: Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-Seq) is a widely used approach to study protein-DNA interactions. Often, the quantities of interest are the differential occupancies relative to controls, between genetic backgrounds, treatments, or combinations thereof. Current methods for differential occupancy of ChIP-Seq data rely however on binning or sliding window techniques, for which the choice of the window and bin sizes are subjective. Results: Here, we present GenoGAM (Genome-wide Generalized Additive Model), which brings the well-established and flexible generalized additive models framework to genomic applications using a data parallelism strategy. We model ChIP-Seq read count frequencies as products of smooth functions along chromosomes. Smoothing parameters are objectively estimated from the data by crossvalidation, eliminating ad hoc binning and windowing needed by current approaches. GenoGAM provides base-level and region-level significance testing for full factorial designs. Application to a ChIP-Seq dataset in yeast showed increased sensitivity over existing differential occupancy methods while controlling for type I error rate. By analyzing a set of DNA methylation data and illustrating an extension to a peak caller, we further demonstrate the potential of GenoGAM as a generic statistical modeling tool for genome-wide assays.},

Here, we generated genomic maps of m(6)A sites in meiotic yeast transcripts at nearly single-nucleotide resolution, identifying 1,308 putatively methylated sites within 1,183 transcripts. We validated eight out of eight methylation sites in different genes with direct genetic analysis, demonstrated that methylated sites are significantly conserved in a related species, and built a model that predicts methylated sites directly from sequence. Sites vary in their methylation profiles along a dense meiotic time course and are regulated both locally, via predictable methylatability of each site, and globally, through the core meiotic circuitry. The methyltransferase complex components localize to the yeast nucleolus, and this localization is essential for mRNA methylation. Our data illuminate a conserved, dynamically regulated methylation program in yeast meiosis and provide an important resource for studying the function of this epitranscriptomic modification.},

abstract = {Replicating circular RNAs are independent plant pathogens known as viroids, or act to modulate the pathogenesis of plant and animal viruses as their satellite RNAs. The rate of discovery of these subviral pathogens was low over the past 40 years because the classical approaches are technical demanding and time-consuming. We previously described an approach for homology-independent discovery of replicating circular RNAs by analysing the total small RNA populations from samples of diseased tissues with a computational program known as progressive filtering of overlapping small RNAs (PFOR). However, PFOR written in PERL language is extremely slow and is unable to discover those subviral pathogens that do not trigger in vivo accumulation of extensively overlapping small RNAs. Moreover, PFOR is yet to identify a new viroid capable of initiating independent infection. Here we report the development of PFOR2 that adopted parallel programming in the C++ language and was 3 to 8 times faster than PFOR. A new computational program was further developed and incorporated into PFOR2 to allow the identification of circular RNAs by deep sequencing of long RNAs instead of small RNAs. PFOR2 analysis of the small RNA libraries from grapevine and apple plants led to the discovery of Grapevine latent viroid (GLVd) and Apple hammerhead viroid-like RNA (AHVd-like RNA), respectively. GLVd was proposed as a new species in the genus Apscaviroid, because it contained the typical structural elements found in this group of viroids and initiated independent infection in grapevine seedlings. AHVd-like RNA encoded a biologically active hammerhead ribozyme in both polarities, and was not specifically associated with any of the viruses found in apple plants. We propose that these computational algorithms have the potential to discover novel circular RNAs in plants, invertebrates and vertebrates regardless of whether they replicate and/or induce the in vivo accumulation of small RNAs.},

abstract = {To date, it remains largely unclear to what extent chromatin machinery contributes to the susceptibility and progression of complex diseases. Here, we combine deep epigenome mapping with single-cell transcriptomics to mine for evidence of chromatin dysregulation in type 2 diabetes. We find two chromatin-state signatures that track $\beta$ cell dysfunction in mice and humans: ectopic activation of bivalent Polycomb-silenced domains and loss of expression at an epigenomically unique class of lineage-defining genes. $\beta$ cell-specific Polycomb (Eed/PRC2) loss of function in mice triggers diabetes-mimicking transcriptional signatures and highly penetrant, hyperglycemia-independent dedifferentiation, indicating that PRC2 dysregulation contributes to disease. The work provides novel resources for exploring $\beta$ cell transcriptional regulation and identifies PRC2 as necessary for long-term maintenance of $\beta$ cell identity. Importantly, the data suggest a two-hit (chromatin and hyperglycemia) model for loss of $\beta$ cell identity in diabetes. Lu et al. provide evidence of chromatin dysregulation in type 2 diabetes in mice and humans. Loss of Polycomb silencing in mouse pancreas triggers hyperglycemia-independent dedifferentiation of $\beta$ cells and diabetes, suggesting a two-hit (chromatin and hyperglycemia) model for loss of $\beta$ cell identity in diabetes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HM450K) measures the DNA methylation of 485,512 CpGs in the human genome. The technology relies on hybridization of genomic fragments to probes on the chip. However, certain genomic factors may compromise the ability to measure methylation using the array such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), small insertions and deletions (INDELs), repetitive DNA, and regions with reduced genomic complexity. Currently, there is no clear method or pipeline for determining which of the probes on the HM450K bead array should be retained for subsequent analysis in light of these issues. RESULTS We comprehensively assessed the effects of SNPs, INDELs, repeats and bisulfite induced reduced genomic complexity by comparing HM450K bead array results with whole genome bisulfite sequencing. We determined which CpG probes provided accurate or noisy signals. From this, we derived a set of high-quality probes that provide unadulterated measurements of DNA methylation. CONCLUSIONS Our method significantly reduces the risk of false discoveries when using the HM450K bead array, while maximising the power of the array to detect methylation status genome-wide. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of our method through extraction of biologically relevant epigenetic changes in prostate cancer.},

However, little is known about the extent of their variability within the human population. Here, we characterise the extent, causes, and effects of naturally occurring variation in expression and sequence of small RNAs from adipose tissue in relation to genotype, gene expression, and metabolic traits in the MuTHER reference cohort. We profiled the expression of 15 to 30 base pair RNA molecules in subcutaneous adipose tissue from 131 individuals using high-throughput sequencing, and quantified levels of 591 microRNAs and small nucleolar RNAs. We identified three genetic variants and three RNA editing events. Highly expressed small RNAs are more conserved within mammals than average, as are those with highly variable expression. We identified 14 genetic loci significantly associated with nearby small RNA expression levels, seven of which also regulate an mRNA transcript level in the same region. In addition, these loci are enriched for variants significant in genome-wide association studies for body mass index. Contrary to expectation, we found no evidence for negative correlation between expression level of a microRNA and its target mRNAs. Trunk fat mass, body mass index, and fasting insulin were associated with more than twenty small RNA expression levels each, while fasting glucose had no significant associations. This study highlights the similar genetic complexity and shared genetic control of small RNA and mRNA transcripts, and gives a quantitative picture of small RNA expression variation in the human population.},

abstract = {It is well known that the underlying mechanisms of osteoporosis in older adults are different than those associated with estrogen deprivation. Age-related bone loss involves a gradual and progressive decline, which is also seen in men. Markedly increased bone resorption leads to the initial fall in bone mineral density. With increasing age, there is also a significant reduction in bone formation. This is mostly due to a shift from osteoblastogenesis to predominant adipogenesis in the bone marrow, which also has a lipotoxic effect that affects matrix formation and mineralization. We review new evidence on the pathophysiology of age-related bone loss with emphasis upon the mechanism of action of current osteoporosis treatments. New potential treatments are also considered, including therapeutic approaches to osteoporosis in the elderly that focus on the pathophysiology and potential reversal of adipogenic shift in bone. {\textcopyright} 2011, SAGE Publications.

abstract = {Messenger RNA of mouse L cells is methylated in both base and ribose moieties. On the average there are about 2.2 methyl groups per 1000 nucleotides in mRNA, a proportion which is about one-sixth that of mammalian ribosomal RNA. The variety of methylated bases in mRNA is more limited than in ribosomal RNA. A very low level of methylation is detected in heterogeneous nuclear RNA, suggesting that methylation, like polyadenylation, may constitute a post-transcriptional modification of messenger RNA precursor in eucaryotic cells.},

abstract = {Noise-induced heterogeneity in gene expression is an inherent reality for cells. However, it is not well understood how noise strength changes for a single gene while the host cell is aging. Using a state-of-the-art microfluidic platform, we measure noise dynamics in aging yeast cells by tracking the generation-specific activity of the canonical GAL1 promoter. We observe noise reduction during normal aging of a cell, followed by a short catastrophe phase in which noise increased. We hypothesize that aging-associated increases in chromatin state transitions are behind the observed noise reduction and a stochastic model provides quantitative support to the proposed mechanism. Noise trends measured from strains with altered GAL1 promoter dynamics (constitutively active, synthetic with nucleosome-disfavoring sequences, and in the absence of RPD3, a global remodeling regulator) lend further support to our hypothesis. Observing similar noise dynamics from a different promoter (HHF2) provides support to the generality of our findings.},

abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are widely expressed noncoding RNAs. However, their biogenesis and possible functions are poorly understood. Here, by studying circRNAs that we identified in neuronal tissues, we provide evidence that animal circRNAs are generated cotranscriptionally and that their production rate is mainly determined by intronic sequences. We demonstrate that circularization and splicing compete against each other. These mechanisms are tissue specific and conserved in animals. Interestingly, we observed that the second exon of the splicing factor muscleblind (MBL/MBNL1) is circularized in flies and humans. This circRNA (circMbl) and its flanking introns contain conserved muscleblind binding sites, which are strongly and specifically bound by MBL. Modulation of MBL levels strongly affects circMbl biosynthesis, and this effect is dependent on the MBL binding sites. Together, our data suggest that circRNAs can function in gene regulation by competing with linear splicing. Furthermore, we identified muscleblind as a factor involved in circRNA biogenesis.},

We also find the cellular composition of blood to vary by season, and these changes, which differ between the United Kingdom and The Gambia, could explain the gene expression periodicity. With regards to tissue function, the immune system has a profound pro-inflammatory transcriptomic profile during European winter, with increased levels of soluble IL-6 receptor and C-reactive protein, risk biomarkers for cardiovascular, psychiatric and autoimmune diseases that have peak incidences in winter.

Here, we report the first genome-scale study of epigenomic dynamics during normal human aging. We identify aging-associated differentially methylated regions (aDMRs) in whole blood in a discovery cohort, and then replicate these aDMRs in sorted CD4(+) T-cells and CD14(+) monocytes in an independent cohort, suggesting that aDMRs occur in precursor haematopoietic cells. Further replication of the aDMRs in buccal cells, representing a tissue that originates from a different germ layer compared with blood, demonstrates that the aDMR signature is a multitissue phenomenon. Moreover, we demonstrate that aging-associated DNA hypermethylation occurs predominantly at bivalent chromatin domain promoters. This same category of promoters, associated with key developmental genes, is frequently hypermethylated in cancers and in vitro cell culture, pointing to a novel mechanistic link between aberrant hypermethylation in cancer, aging, and cell culture.},

Fundamental to many of the applications of RNA-Seq is the quantification problem, which is the accurate measurement of relative transcript abundances from the sequenced reads. We focus on this problem, and review many recently published models that are used to estimate the relative abundances. In addition to describing the models and the different approaches to inference, we also explain how methods are related to each other. A key result is that we show how inference with many of the models results in identical estimates of relative abundances, even though model formulations can be very different. In fact, we are able to show how a single general model captures many of the elements of previously published methods. We also review the applications of RNA-Seq models to differential analysis, and explain why accurate relative transcript abundance estimates are crucial for downstream analyses.},

abstract = {Differentially methylated or hydroxymethylated regions (DMRs) in mammalian DNA are often associated with tissue-specific gene expression but the functional relationships are still being unraveled. To elucidate these relationships, we studied 16 human genes containing myogenic DMRs by analyzing profiles of their epigenetics and transcription and quantitatively assaying 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5 hmC) and 5-methylcytosine (5 mC) at specific sites in these genes in skeletal muscle (SkM), myoblasts, heart, brain, and diverse other samples. Although most human promoters have little or no methylation regardless of expression, more than half of the genes that we chose to study-owing to their myogenic DMRs-overlapped tissue-specific alternative or cryptic promoters displaying corresponding tissue-specific differences in histone modifications. The 5 mC levels in myoblast DMRs were significantly associated with 5 hmC levels in SkM at the same site. Hypermethylated myogenic DMRs within CDH15, a muscle- and cerebellum-specific cell adhesion gene, and PITX3, a homeobox gene, were used for transfection in reporter gene constructs. These intragenic DMRs had bidirectional tissue-specific promoter activity that was silenced by in vivo-like methylation. The CDH15 DMR, which was previously associated with an imprinted maternal germline DMR in mice, had especially strong promoter activity in myogenic host cells. These findings are consistent with the controversial hypothesis that intragenic DNA methylation can facilitate transcription and is not just a passive consequence of it. Our results support varied roles for tissue-specific 5 mC- or 5 hmC-enrichment in suppressing inappropriate gene expression of cryptic or alternative promoters and in increasing the plasticity of gene expression required for development and rapid responses to tissue stress or damage.},

abstract = {The Tol-Pal system of Escherichia coli is required for the maintenance of outer membrane stability. Recently, proton motive force (pmf) has been found to be necessary for the co-precipitation of the outer membrane lipoprotein Pal with the inner membrane TolA protein, indicating that the Tol-Pal system forms a transmembrane link in which TolA is energized. In this study, we show that both TolQ and TolR proteins are essential for the TolA-Pal interaction. A point mutation within the third transmembrane (TM) segment of TolQ was found to affect the TolA-Pal interaction strongly, whereas suppressor mutations within the TM segment of TolR restored this interaction. Modifying the Asp residue within the TM region of TolR indicated that an acidic residue was important for the pmf-dependent interaction of TolA with Pal and outer membrane stabilization. Analysis of sequence alignments of TolQ and TolR homologues from numerous Gram-negative bacterial genomes, together with analyses of the different tolQ-tolR mutants, revealed that the TM domains of TolQ and TolR present structural and functional homologies not only to ExbB and ExbD of the TonB system but also with MotA and MotB of the flagellar motor. The function of these three systems, as ion potential-driven molecular motors, is discussed},

RNA deep sequencing (RNA-seq) has greatly facilitated the study of tRFs. However, the repeat nature of the tRNA templates and the idiosyncrasies of tRNA sequences necessitate the development and use of methodologies that differ markedly from those used to analyze RNA-seq data when studying microRNAs (miRNAs) or messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Here we present MINTmap (for MItochondrial and Nuclear TRF mapping), a method and a software package that was developed specifically for the quick, deterministic and exhaustive identification of tRFs in short RNA-seq datasets. In addition to identifying them, MINTmap is able to unambiguously calculate and report both raw and normalized abundances for the discovered tRFs. Furthermore, to ensure specificity, MINTmap identifies the subset of discovered tRFs that could be originating outside of tRNA space and flags them as candidate false positives. Our comparative analysis shows that MINTmap exhibits superior sensitivity and specificity to other available methods while also being exceptionally fast.

abstract = {The process of aging results in a host of changes at the cellular and molecular levels, which include senescence, telomere shortening, and changes in gene expression. Epigenetic patterns also change over the lifespan, suggesting that epigenetic changes may constitute an important component of the aging process. The epigenetic mark that has been most highly studied is DNA methylation, the presence of methyl groups at CpG dinucleotides. These dinucleotides are often located near gene promoters and associate with gene expression levels. Early studies indicated that global levels of DNA methylation increase over the first few years of life and then decrease beginning in late adulthood. Recently, with the advent of microarray and next-generation sequencing technologies, increases in variability of DNA methylation with age have been observed, and a number of site-specific patterns have been identified. It has also been shown that certain CpG sites are highly associated with age, to the extent that prediction models using a small number of these sites can accurately predict the chronological age of the donor. Together, these observations point to the existence of two phenomena that both contribute to age-related DNA methylation changes: epigenetic drift and the epigenetic clock. In this review, we focus on healthy human aging throughout the lifetime and discuss the dynamics of DNA methylation as well as how interactions between the genome, environment, and the epigenome influence aging rates. We also discuss the impact of determining 'epigenetic age' for human health and outline some important caveats to existing and future studies.},

Materials {\&}methods: Here,we construct and validate a DNA methylation reference and algorithm for complex tissues that contain epithelial,immuneand nonimmunestromal cells. Results: Using this reference, we show that easily accessible tissues such as saliva, buccal and cervix exhibit substantial variation in immune cell (IC) contamination. We further validate our reference in the context of oral cancer, where it correctly predicts an increased IC infiltration in cancer but suppressed in patients with highest smoking exposure. Finally, our method can improve the specificity of differentially methylatedCpG calls in epithelial cancer. Conclusion: The degree and variation of IC contamination in complex epithelial tissues is substantial. We provide a valuable resource and tool for assessing the epithelial purity and IC contamination of samples and for identifying differential methylation in such complex tissues.},

Mutant males also show extended life spans. age-1(hx546) is associated with a 75{\%} decrease in hermaphrodite self-fertility as compared to the age- I' allele at 20° . Using two novel strategies for following the segregation ofage-1, we present evidence that longer life results from a mutation in a single gene that increases the probability of survival at all chronological ages. The long-life and reduced-fertility phenotypes cosegregate and are tightly linked to fer-15, a locus on linkage group 11 . age-1(hx546) does not affect the timing of larval molts, the length of embryogenesis, food uptake, movement, or behavior in any way tested . Although age- 1(hx546) lowers hermaphrodite self-fertility, it does not markedly affect the length of the reproductive period with all the increase in life expectancy due to an increase in the length of postreproductive life . In so far as we are aware, this mutant in age-1 is the only instance of a well-characterized genetic locus in which the mutant form results in lengthened life . It is likely that the action of age-1 in lengthening life results not from eliminating a programmed aging function but rather from reduced hermaphrodite self-fertility or from some other unknown metabolic or physiologic alteration .},

abstract = {Histone variants are non-allelic protein isoforms that play key roles in diversifying chromatin structure. The known number of such variants has greatly increased in recent years, but the lack of naming conventions for them has led to a variety of naming styles, multiple synonyms and misleading homographs that obscure variant relationships and complicate database searches. We propose here a unified nomenclature for variants of all five classes of histones that uses consistent but flexible naming conventions to produce names that are informative and readily searchable. The nomenclature builds on historical usage and incorporates phylogenetic relationships, which are strong predictors of structure and function. A key feature is the consistent use of punctuation to represent phylogenetic divergence, making explicit the relationships among variant subtypes that have previously been implicit or unclear. We recommend that by default new histone variants be named with organism-specific paralog-number suffixes that lack phylogenetic implication, while letter suffixes be reserved for structurally distinct clades of variants. For clarity and searchability, we encourage the use of descriptors that are separate from the phylogeny-based variant name to indicate developmental and other properties of variants that may be independent of structure. {\textcopyright} 2012 Talbert et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Patterns of DNA methylation (5-methylcytosine, 5mC) are rearranged during differentiation contributing to the regulation of cell type-specific gene expression. TET proteins oxidize 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). Both 5fC and 5caC can be recognized and excised from DNA by thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG) followed by the subsequent incorporation of unmodified cytosine into the abasic site via the base excision repair (BER) pathway. We previously demonstrated that 5caC accumulates during lineage specification of neural stem cells (NSCs) suggesting that such active demethylation pathway is operational in this system; however, it is still unknown if TDG/BER-dependent demethylation is used during other types of cellular differentiation. Here we analyze dynamics of the global levels of 5hmC and 5caC during differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells toward hepatic endoderm. We show that, similar to differentiating NSCs, 5caC transiently accumulates during hepatic differentiation. The levels of 5caC increase during specification of foregut, peak at the stage of hepatic endoderm commitment, and drop in differentiating cells concurrently with the onset of expression of $\alpha$ fetoprotein, a marker of committed hepatic progenitors. Moreover, we show that 5caC accumulates at promoter regions of several genes expressed during hepatic specification at differentiation stages corresponding to the beginning of their expression. Our data indicate that transient 5caC accumulation is a common feature of 2 different types (neural/glial and endoderm/hepatic) of cellular differentiation. This suggests that oxidation of 5mC may represent a general mechanism of rearrangement of 5mC profiles during lineage specification of somatic cells in mammals.},

Recruitment of Pol III onto these genes requires prior binding of well-characterized transcription factors. Technical limitations in dealing with repeated genomic units, typically found at mammalian Pol III genes, have so far hampered genome-wide studies of the Pol III transcription machinery and transcriptome. We have localized, genome-wide, Pol III and some of its transcription factors. Our results reveal broad usage of the known Pol III transcription machinery and define a minimal Pol III transcriptome in dividing IMR90hTert fibroblasts. This transcriptome consists of some 500 actively transcribed genes including a few dozen candidate novel genes, of which we confirmed nine as Pol III transcription units by additional methods. It does not contain any of the microRNA genes previously described as transcribed by Pol III, but reveals two other microRNA genes, MIR886 (hsa-mir-886) and MIR1975 (RNY5, hY5, hsa-mir-1975), which are genuine Pol III transcription units.},

abstract = {In recent years, protein-ligand docking has become a powerful tool for drug development. Although several approaches suitable for high throughput screening are available, there is a need for methods able to identify binding modes with high accuracy. This accuracy is essential to reliably compute the binding free energy of the ligand. Such methods are needed when the binding mode of lead compounds is not determined experimentally but is needed for structure-based lead optimization. We present here a new docking software, called EADock, that aims at this goal. It uses an hybrid evolutionary algorithm with two fitness functions, in combination with a sophisticated management of the diversity. EADock is interfaced with the CHARMM package for energy calculations and coordinate handling. A validation was carried out on 37 crystallized protein-ligand complexes featuring 11 different proteins. The search space was defined as a sphere of 15 A around the center of mass of the ligand position in the crystal structure, and on the contrary to other benchmarks, our algorithm was fed with optimized ligand positions up to 10 A root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the crystal structure, excluding the latter. This validation illustrates the efficiency of our sampling strategy, as correct binding modes, defined by a RMSD to the crystal structure lower than 2 A, were identified and ranked first for 68{\%} of the complexes. The success rate increases to 78{\%} when considering the five best ranked clusters, and 92{\%} when all clusters present in the last generation are taken into account. Most failures could be explained by the presence of crystal contacts in the experimental structure. Finally, the ability of EADock to accurately predict binding modes on a real application was illustrated by the successful docking of the RGD cyclic pentapeptide on the alphaVbeta3 integrin, starting far away from the binding pocket.},

Furthermore, we reveal the presence of 5fC and 5caC in genomic DNA of mouse embryonic stem cells and mouse organs. The genomic content of 5hmC, 5fC, and 5caC can be increased or reduced through overexpression or depletion of Tet proteins. Thus, we identify two previously unknown cytosine derivatives in genomic DNA as the products of Tet proteins.

abstract = {The translation initiator-tRNA plays a crucial role in the initiation of protein synthesis in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, by employing specific base pairing between its anticodon triplet CAU and the general initiation codon AUG in the mRNA. Here we show that the initiator-tRNA may also act, in a manner that is independent of its role in protein translation, as a pre-mRNA splicing regulator. Specifically, we show that alternative splicing events that are induced by mutations in the translation initiation AUG codon can be suppressed by expressing initiator-tRNA constructs carrying anticodon mutations that compensate for the AUG mutations. These mutated initiator-tRNAs appeared to be uncharged with an amino acid. Our results imply that recognition of the initiation AUG sequence by the anticodon triplet of initiator-tRNA in its unloaded state plays a role in quality control of splicing in the cell nucleus by a yet unresolved mechanism. Identifying the initiatort-RNA as a transacting splicing regulator suggests a novel involvement of this molecule in splicing regulation and provides a critical step toward deciphering this intriguing mechanism.},

abstract = {Evolution drives, and is driven by, demography. A genotype moulds its phenotype's age patterns of mortality and fertility in an environment; these two patterns in turn determine the genotype's fitness in that environment. Hence, to understand the evolution of ageing, age patterns of mortality and reproduction need to be compared for species across the tree of life. However, few studies have done so and only for a limited range of taxa. Here we contrast standardized patterns over age for 11 mammals, 12 other vertebrates, 10 invertebrates, 12 vascular plants and a green alga. Although it has been predicted that evolution should inevitably lead to increasing mortality and declining fertility with age after maturity, there is great variation among these species, including increasing, constant, decreasing, humped and bowed trajectories for both long-and short-lived species. This diversity challenges theoreticians to develop broader perspectives on the evolution of ageing and empiricists to study the demography of more species. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND DNA methylation is one of the most phylogenetically widespread epigenetic modifications of genomic DNA. In particular, DNA methylation of transcription units ('gene bodies') is highly conserved across diverse taxa. However, the functional role of gene body methylation is not yet fully understood. A long-standing hypothesis posits that gene body methylation reduces transcriptional noise associated with spurious transcription of genes. Despite the plausibility of this hypothesis, an explicit test of this hypothesis has not been performed until now. RESULTS Using nucleotide-resolution data on genomic DNA methylation and abundant microarray data, here we investigate the relationship between DNA methylation and transcriptional noise. Transcriptional noise measured from microarrays scales down with expression abundance, confirming findings from single-cell studies. We show that gene body methylation is significantly negatively associated with transcriptional noise when examined in the context of other biological factors. CONCLUSIONS This finding supports the hypothesis that gene body methylation suppresses transcriptional noise. Heavy methylation of vertebrate genomes may have evolved as a global regulatory mechanism to control for transcriptional noise. In contrast, promoter methylation exhibits positive correlations with the level of transcriptional noise. We hypothesize that methylated promoters tend to undergo more frequent transcriptional bursts than those that avoid DNA methylation.},

abstract = {Human genome-wide association studies have linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 9p21.3 near the INK4/ARF (CDKN2a/b) locus with susceptibility to atherosclerotic vascular disease (ASVD). Although this locus encodes three well-characterized tumor suppressors, p16(INK4a), p15(INK4b), and ARF, the SNPs most strongly associated with ASVD are ∼120 kb from the nearest coding gene within a long non-coding RNA (ncRNA) known as ANRIL (CDKN2BAS). While individuals homozygous for the atherosclerotic risk allele show decreased expression of ANRIL and the coding INK4/ARF transcripts, the mechanism by which such distant genetic variants influence INK4/ARF expression is unknown. Here, using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and analysis of next-generation RNA sequencing datasets, we determined the structure and abundance of multiple ANRIL species. Each of these species was present at very low copy numbers in primary and cultured cells; however, only the expression of ANRIL isoforms containing exons proximal to the INK4/ARF locus correlated with the ASVD risk alleles. Surprisingly, RACE also identified transcripts containing non-colinear ANRIL exonic sequences, whose expression also correlated with genotype and INK4/ARF expression. These non-polyadenylated RNAs resisted RNAse R digestion and could be PCR amplified using outward-facing primers, suggesting they represent circular RNA structures that could arise from by-products of mRNA splicing. Next-generation DNA sequencing and splice prediction algorithms identified polymorphisms within the ASVD risk interval that may regulate ANRIL splicing and circular ANRIL (cANRIL) production. These results identify novel circular RNA products emanating from the ANRIL locus and suggest causal variants at 9p21.3 regulate INK4/ARF expression and ASVD risk by modulating ANRIL expression and/or structure.},

abstract = {Interspersed repeat sequences comprise much of our DNA, although their functional effects are poorly understood. The most commonly occurring repeat is the Alu short interspersed element. New Alu insertions occur in human populations, and have been responsible for several instances of genetic disease. In this study, we sought to determine if there are instances of polymorphic Alu insertion variants that function in a common variant, common disease paradigm. We cataloged 809 polymorphic Alu elements mapping to 1,159 loci implicated in disease risk by genome-wide association study (GWAS) (P {\textless} 10-8). We found that Alu insertion variants occur disproportionately at GWAS loci (P = 0.013). Moreover, we identified 44 of these Alu elements in linkage disequilibrium (r2 {\textgreater} 0.7) with the trait-associated SNP. This figure represents a {\textgreater} 20-fold increase in the number of polymorphic Alu elements associated with human phenotypes. This work provides a broader perspective on how structural variants in repetitive DNAs may contribute to human disease.},

abstract = {Semi-automated genome annotation methods such as Segway enable understanding of chromatin activity. Here we present chromatin state annotations of 164 human cell types using 1,615 genomics data sets. To produce these annotations, we developed a fully-automated annotation strategy in which we train separate unsupervised annotation models on each cell type and use a machine learning classifier to automate the state interpretation step. Using these annotations, we developed a measure of the functional importance of each genomic position called the "functionality score", which allows us to aggregate information across cell types into a multi-cell type view. This score provides a measure of importance directly attributable to a specific activity in a specific set of cell types. In contrast to evolutionary conservation, this measure is not biased to detect only elements shared with related species. Using the functionality score, we combined all our annotations into a single cell type-agnostic encyclopedia that catalogs all human functional regulatory elements, enabling easy and intuitive interpretation of the effect of genome variants on phenotype, such as in disease-associated, evolutionary conserved or positively selected loci.

abstract = {Bdellovibrio species are naturally predatory, small, motile, Deltaproteobacteria that invade the periplasm of other larger gram-negative bacteria, killing and digesting them. Bdellovibrio grows and divides inside the prey cell, in a structure called a bdelloplast, which then lyses, releasing the Bdellovibrio to prey upon more bacteria. This capability makes Bdellovibrio a potential therapeutic agent, but since its discovery in the 1960s it has not been applied in this way. This review considers what is known postgenomically about Bdellovibrio and its predatory lifestyle, drawing also from what was learned by the excellent microbial physiology work of the early Bdellovibrio researchers. Recent work on the diversity and evolution of predatory bdellovibrios, the role of surface structures in predation, and the ongoing questions about how Bdellovibrio switches between axenic and predatory growth and how its predatory activities may be tempered in the wild, as well as suggestions for future research priorities, are discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Recently, thousands of circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been discovered in various tissues and cell types from human, mouse, fruit fly and nematodes. However, expression of circRNAs across mammalian brain development has never been examined. RESULTS Here we profile the expression of circRNA in five brain tissues at up to six time-points during fetal porcine development, constituting the first report of circRNA in the brain development of a large animal. An unbiased analysis reveals a highly complex regulation pattern of thousands of circular RNAs, with a distinct spatio-temporal expression profile. The amount and complexity of circRNA expression was most pronounced in cortex at day 60 of gestation. At this time-point we find 4634 unique circRNAs expressed from 2195 genes out of a total of 13,854 expressed genes. Approximately 20 {\%} of the porcine splice sites involved in circRNA production are functionally conserved between mouse and human. Furthermore, we observe that "hot-spot" genes produce multiple circRNA isoforms, which are often differentially expressed across porcine brain development. A global comparison of porcine circRNAs reveals that introns flanking circularized exons are longer than average and more frequently contain proximal complementary SINEs, which potentially can facilitate base pairing between the flanking introns. Finally, we report the first use of RNase R treatment in combination with in situ hybridization to show dynamic subcellular localization of circRNA during development. CONCLUSIONS These data demonstrate that circRNAs are highly abundant and dynamically expressed in a spatio-temporal manner in porcine fetal brain, suggesting important functions during mammalian brain development.},

abstract = {The vast majority of prenatal genetic testing requires invasive sampling. However, this poses a risk to the fetus, so one must make a decision that weighs the desire for genetic information against the risk of an adverse outcome due to hazards of the testing process. These issues are not required to be coupled, and it would be desirable to discover genetic information about the fetus without incurring a health risk. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to non-invasively sequence the entire prenatal genome. Our results show that molecular counting of parental haplotypes in maternal plasma by shotgun sequencing of maternal plasma DNA allows the inherited fetal genome to be deciphered non-invasively. We also applied the counting principle directly to each allele in the fetal exome by performing exome capture on maternal plasma DNA before shotgun sequencing. This approach enables non-invasive exome screening of clinically relevant and deleterious alleles that were paternally inherited or had arisen as de novo germline mutations, and complements the haplotype counting approach to provide a comprehensive view of the fetal genome. Non-invasive determination of the fetal genome may ultimately facilitate the diagnosis of all inherited and de novo genetic disease.},

abstract = {Bacillus subtilis uses novel regulatory mechanisms in controlling expression of its genes of tryptophan synthesis and transport. These mechanisms respond to changes in the intracellular concentrations of free tryptophan and uncharged tRNA(Trp). The major B. subtilis protein that regulates tryptophan biosynthesis is the tryptophan-activated RNA-binding attenuation protein, TRAP. TRAP is a ring-shaped molecule composed of 11 identical subunits. Active TRAP binds to unique RNA segments containing multiple trinucleotide (NAG) repeats. Binding regulates both transcription termination and translation in the trp operon, and translation of other coding regions relevant to tryptophan metabolism. When there is a deficiency of charged tRNA(Trp), B. subtilis forms an anti-TRAP protein, AT. AT antagonizes TRAP function, thereby increasing expression of all the genes regulated by TRAP. Thus B. subtilis and Escherichia coli respond to identical regulatory signals, tryptophan and uncharged tRNA(Trp), yet they employ different mechanisms in regulating trp gene expression.},

abstract = {The human small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and small cytoplasmic RNA (scRNA) gene families encode diverse non-coding RNAs that influence cellular growth and division. Many snRNA and scRNA genes are related via their compact and yet powerful promoters that support RNA polymerase III transcription. We have utilized the human U6 snRNA gene family to examine the mechanism for regulated transcription of these potent transcription units. Analysis of nine U6 family members showed enriched CpG density within the promoters of actively transcribed loci relative to inert genes, implying a relationship between gene potency and DNA methylation. Indeed, both pharmacological inhibition of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity and the forced diminution of DNMT-1, DNMT-3a, and DNMT-3b by siRNA targeting resulted in increased U6 levels in asynchronously growing MCF7 adenocarcinoma cells. In vitro transcription assays further showed that template methylation impedes U6 transcription by RNA polymerase III. Both DNMT-1 and DNMT-3a were detected at the U6-1 locus by chromatin immunoprecipitation directly linking these factors to RNA polymerase III regulation. Despite this association, the endogenous U6-1 locus was not substantially methylated in actively growing cells. However, both DNMT occupancy and low frequency methylation were correlated with increased Retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (RB) expression, suggesting that the RB status can influence specific epigenetic marks.},

abstract = {The covalent addition of methylgroups to cytosine has become the most intensively researched epigenetic DNA marker. The vast majority of technologies used for DNA methylation analysis rely on a chemical reaction, the so-called 'bisulfite treatment', which introduces methylation-dependent sequence changes through selective chemical conversion of non-methylated cytosine to uracil. After treatment, all non-methylated cytosine bases are converted to uracil but all methylated cytosine bases remain cytosine. These methylation dependent C-to-T changes can subsequently be studied using conventional DNA analysis technologies. The bisulfite conversion protocol is susceptible to processing errors, and small deviation from the protocol can result in failure of the treatment. Several attempts have been made to simplify the procedure and increase its robustness. Although significant achievements in this area have been made, bisulfite treatment remains the main source of process variability in the analysis of DNA methylation. This variability in particular impairs assays, which strive for the quantitative assessment of DNA methylation. Here we present basic mathematical considerations, which should be taken into account when analyzing DNA methylation. We also introduce a PCR-based assay, which allows ab initio assessment of the DNA quality after bisulfite treatment and can help to prevent inaccurate quantitative measurement resulting from poor bisulfite treatment.},

Communication between dermal papilla cells and the overlying epithelium is essential for differentiation of the hair follicle lineages. We report that Sox2 is expressed in all dermal papillae at E16.5, but from E18.5 onwards expression is confined to a subset of dermal papillae. In postnatal skin, Sox2 is only expressed in the dermal papillae of guard/awl/auchene follicles, whereas CD133 is expressed both in guard/awl/auchene and in zigzag dermal papillae. Using transgenic mice that express GFP under the control of the Sox2 promoter, we isolated Sox2(+) (GFP(+)) CD133(+) cells and compared them with Sox2(-) (GFP(-)) CD133(+) dermal papilla cells. In addition to the 'core' dermal papilla gene signature, each subpopulation expressed distinct sets of genes. GFP(+) CD133(+) cells had upregulated Wnt, FGF and BMP pathways and expressed neural crest markers. In GFP(-) CD133(+) cells, the hedgehog, IGF, Notch and integrin pathways were prominent. In skin reconstitution assays, hair follicles failed to form when dermis was depleted of both GFP(+) CD133(+) and GFP(-) CD133(+) cells. In the absence of GFP(+) CD133(+) cells, awl/auchene hairs failed to form and only zigzag hairs were found.

abstract = {A reliable method has been developed for the isolation of host-independent (H-I; i.e., "saprophytic") strains of Bdellovibrio from host-dependent (H-D; i.e., "parasitic") cultures. The technique involves growing streptomycin-resistant (Sm(r)) H-D cultures on streptomycin-susceptible (Sm(8)) host cells. A lysate containing large numbers of the Sm(r) H-D cells and some remaining Sm(8) host cells is transferred to a selection medium which contains the antibiotic. The Sm(8) host cells in the lysate are killed, and the Sm(r) H-I strains develop in broth within 3 to 6 days. By use of this method, it has been possible to isolate H-I strains from 16 different H-D Bdellovibrio strains studied. The frequency of occurrence of host independence is in the range of one H-I colony per 10(6) to 10(7) plaque-forming units of H-D bdellovibrios. The H-I cultures are nonfermentative, do not reduce nitrate, are strongly proteolytic, are oxidase-positive, and do not utilize 14 different carbon compounds as sources of energy for growth. Most H-I cultures are catalase-positive upon initial isolation from H-D lysates, but some cultures lose this enzyme upon subsequent transfers through host-free media. Most H-I bdellovibrios are pleomorphic, consisting of vibrio- to spiral-shaped cells typically measuring 0.3 to 0.4 mum in width and 1 to 10 mum in length. All H-I bdellovibrios have a cytochrome a and c component (H-I A3.12 differs from the other strains in the location of the peaks of the cytochrome spectrum). All are sensitive to oxytetracycline and (except for strain H-I A3.12) to the vibriostatic pteridine 0/129; most bdellovibrios, except for H-I A3.12, are generally uniformly resistant or susceptible to a given antibiotic. Bdellovibrio and Vibrio spp. have common cytochrome difference spectra and susceptibilities to oxytetracycline and to the vibriostatic pteridine 0/129. All H-I bdellovibrios examined produce an exocellular protease which digests heat-killed host cells. Bdellovibrios possessing predatory and bacteriolytic properties could be reselected from H-I bdellovibrio cultures growing in the presence of living host cells. Attempts to select for bacteriolytic isolates from Vibrio and Spirillum spp. were unsuccessul.},

To train the DNNs, we used over 60,000 samples from common blood biochemistry and cell count tests from routine health exams performed by a single laboratory and linked to chronological age and sex. The best performing DNN in the ensemble demonstrated 81.5 {\%} epsilon-accuracy r = 0.90 with R(2) = 0.80 and MAE = 6.07 years in predicting chronological age within a 10 year frame, while the entire ensemble achieved 83.5{\%} epsilon-accuracy r = 0.91 with R(2) = 0.82 and MAE = 5.55 years. The ensemble also identified the 5 most important markers for predicting human chronological age: albumin, glucose, alkaline phosphatase, urea and erythrocytes. To allow for public testing and evaluate real-life performance of the predictor, we developed an online system available at http://www.aging.ai. The ensemble approach may facilitate integration of multi-modal data linked to chronological age and sex that may lead to simple, minimally invasive, and affordable methods of tracking integrated biomarkers of aging in humans and performing cross-species feature importance analysis.},

abstract = {Circadian rhythms are based on endogenous clocks that allow organisms to adjust their physiology and behavior by entrainment to the solar day and, in turn, to select the optimal times for most biological variables. Diverse model systems - including mice, flies, fungi, plants, and bacteria - have provided important insights into the mechanisms of circadian rhythmicity. However, the general principles that govern the circadian clock of Caenorhabditis elegans have remained largely elusive. Here we report robust molecular circadian rhythms in C. elegans recorded with a bioluminescence assay in vivo and demonstrate the main features of the circadian system of the nematode. By constructing a luciferase-based reporter coupled to the promoter of the suppressor of activated let-60 Ras (sur-5) gene, we show in both population and single-nematode assays that C. elegans expresses ∼24-h rhythms that can be entrained by light/dark and temperature cycles. We provide evidence that these rhythms are temperature-compensated and can be re-entrained after phase changes of the synchronizing agents. In addition, we demonstrate that light and temperature sensing requires the photoreceptors LITE and GUR-3, and the cyclic nucleotide-gated channel subunit TAX-2. Our results shed light on C. elegans circadian biology and demonstrate evolutionarily conserved features in the circadian system of the nematode.},

abstract = {Ageing in diverse species ranging from yeast to humans is associated with extensive changes in both general and specific protein synthesis. Accumulating evidence now indicates that these alterations are not simply a corollary of the ageing process but, rather, they have a causative role in senescent decline. Indeed, interfering with mRNA translation significantly influences longevity. Interestingly, the mechanisms that control mRNA translation interface with intricate, conserved signalling pathways and specific conditions that regulate ageing, such as the insulin-insulin growth factor 1 signalling pathway and caloric restriction. This emerging relationship reveals that protein synthesis is a novel determinant of ageing in diverse organisms such as yeast, worms, flies and mice and can thus be considered as a universal component of the ageing process. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We compared the human and chimpanzee genomes to identify DNA sequence signatures correlated with rates of mutation at CpG dinucleotides. The new signatures were used to develop robust comparative genomics of CpG dinucleotides in heterogeneous regions and to identify genomic domains that have anomalous CpG divergence rates. The data showed that there are approximately 200 genomic regions where CpG distributions are far more conserved than predicted. These hyperconserved CpG domains largely coincide with domains bound by Polycomb repressive complex 2 in undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells and are almost exclusively present near genes whose products are involved in the regulation of embryonic development. Several domains were experimentally shown to be unmethylated at different developmental stages. These data indicate that particular evolutionary patterns and distinct sequence properties on scales much larger than standard transcription factor-binding sites may play an important role in Polycomb recruitment and transcriptional regulation of key developmental genes.},

abstract = {DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that plays a key role in gene regulation. Previous studies have investigated its genetic basis by mapping genetic variants that are associated with DNA methylation at specific sites, but these have been limited to microarrays that cover {\textless}2{\%} of the genome and cannot account for allele-specific methylation (ASM). Other studies have performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing on a few individuals, but these lack statistical power to identify variants associated with DNA methylation. We present a novel approach in which bisulfite-treated DNA from many individuals is sequenced together in a single pool, resulting in a truly genome-wide map of DNA methylation. Compared to methods that do not account for ASM, our approach increases statistical power to detect associations while sharply reducing cost, effort, and experimental variability. As a proof of concept, we generated deep sequencing data from a pool of 60 human cell lines; we evaluated almost twice as many CpGs as the largest microarray studies and identified more than 2000 genetic variants associated with DNA methylation. We found that these variants are highly enriched for associations with chromatin accessibility and CTCF binding but are less likely to be associated with traits indirectly linked to DNA, such as gene expression and disease phenotypes. In summary, our approach allows genome-wide mapping of genetic variants associated with DNA methylation in any tissue of any species, without the need for individual-level genotype or methylation data.},

abstract = {The methylation of internal adenosine residues in eukaryotic mRNA, forming N6-methyladenosine (m6A), is catalyzed by a complex multicomponent enzyme. Previous studies suggested that m6A affects the efficiency of mRNA processing or transport, although the mechanism by which this occurs is not known. As a step toward better understanding the mechanism and function of this ubiquitous posttranscriptional modification, we have shown that HeLa mRNA (N6-adenosine)-methyltransferase requires at least two separate protein factors, MT-A and MT-B, and MT-A contains the AdoMet binding site on a 70-kDa subunit (MT-A70). MT-A70 was purified by conventional chromatography and electrophoresis, and was microsequenced. The peptide sequence was used to design a degenerate oligodeoxynucleotide that in turn was used to isolate the cDNA clone coding for MT-A70 from a HeLa cDNA library. Recombinant MT-A70 was expressed as a fusion protein in bacteria and was used to generate anti-MT-A70 antisera in rabbits. These antisera recognize MT-A70 in HeLa nuclear extracts by western blot and are capable of depleting (N6-adenosine)-methyltransferase activity from HeLa nuclear extract, confirming that MT-A70 is a critical subunit of (N6-adenosine)-methyltransferase. Northern blot analysis reveals that MT-A70 mRNA is present in a wide variety of human tissues and may undergo alternative splicing. MT-A70 cDNA probe hybridizes to a 2.0-kilobase (kb) polyadenylated RNA isolated from HeLa cells, whereas it hybridizes to two predominant RNA species (approximately 2.0 kb and 3.0 kb) using mRNA isolated from six different human tissues. Analysis of the cDNA sequence indicates that it codes for a 580-amino acid protein with a predicted MW = 65 kDa. The predicted protein contains sequences similar to consensus methylation motifs I and II identified in prokaryotic DNA (N6-adenosine)-methyltransferases, suggesting the functional conservation of peptide motifs. MT-A70 also contains a long region of homology to the yeast protein SPO8, which is involved in induction of sporulation by an unknown mechanism.},

abstract = {Internal methylation of eukaryotic mRNAs in the form of N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) and 5-methylcytidine (m(5)C) has long been known to exist, but progress in understanding its role was hampered by difficulties in identifying individual sites. This was recently overcome by high-throughput sequencing-based methods that mapped thousands of sites for both modifications throughout mammalian transcriptomes, with most sites found in mRNAs. The topology of m(6)A in mouse and human revealed both conserved and variable sites as well as plasticity in response to extracellular cues. Within mRNAs, m(5)C and m(6)A sites were relatively depleted in coding sequences and enriched in untranslated regions, suggesting functional interactions with post-transcriptional gene control. Finer distribution analyses and preexisting literature point toward roles in the regulation of mRNA splicing, translation, or decay, through an interplay with RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs. The methyltransferase (MTase) METTL3 'writes' m(6)A marks on mRNA, whereas the demethylase FTO can 'erase' them. The RNA:m(5)C MTases NSUN2 and TRDMT1 have roles in tRNA methylation but they also act on mRNA. Proper functioning of these enzymes is important in development and there are clear links to human disease. For instance, a common variant of FTO is a risk allele for obesity carried by 1 billion people worldwide and mutations cause a lethal syndrome with growth retardation and brain deficits. NSUN2 is linked to cancer and stem cell biology and mutations cause intellectual disability. In this review, we summarize the advances, open questions, and intriguing possibilities in this emerging field that might be called RNA modomics or epitranscriptomics.},

abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel type of RNA that, unlike linear RNAs, form a covalently closed continuous loop and are highly represented in the eukaryotic transcriptome. Recent studies have discovered thousands of endogenous circRNAs in mammalian cells. CircRNAs are largely generated from exonic or intronic sequences, and reverse complementary sequences or RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are necessary for circRNA biogenesis. The majority of circRNAs are conserved across species, are stable and resistant to RNase R, and often exhibit tissue/developmental-stage-specific expression. Recent research has revealed that circRNAs can function as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, regulators of splicing and transcription, and modifiers of parental gene expression. Emerging evidence indicates that circRNAs might play important roles in atherosclerotic vascular disease risk, neurological disorders, prion diseases and cancer; exhibit aberrant expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC); and serve as diagnostic or predictive biomarkers of some diseases. Similar to miRNAs and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), circRNAs are becoming a new research hotspot in the field of RNA and could be widely involved in the processes of life. Herein, we review the formation and properties of circRNAs, their functions, and their potential significance in disease.},

Here, we generated genomic maps of m6A sites in meiotic yeast transcripts at nearly single-nucleotide resolution, identifying 1,308 putatively methylated sites within 1,183 transcripts. We validated eight out of eight methylation sites in different genes with direct genetic analysis, demonstrated that methylated sites are significantly conserved in a related species, and built a model that predicts methylated sites directly from sequence. Sites vary in their methylation profiles along a dense meiotic time course and are regulated both locally, via predictable methylatability of each site, and globally, through the core meiotic circuitry. The methyltransferase complex components localize to the yeast nucleolus, and this localization is essential for mRNA methylation. Our data illuminate a conserved, dynamically regulated methylation program in yeast meiosis and provide an important resource for studying the function of this epitranscriptomic modification. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers regulate access to genetic information by controlling nucleosome positions in vivo1. However, the mechanism by which remodelers discriminate between different nucleosome substrates is poorly understood. Considering that many chromatin remodeling proteins possess conserved protein domains that interact with nucleosomal features2, we employed a quantitative high-throughput approach, based on the use of a DNA-barcoded mononucleosome library, to profile the biochemical activity of human ISWI remodelers in response to a diverse set of nucleosome modifications. We show that accessory (non-ATPase) subunits of ISWI remodelers can distinguish between differentially modified nucleosomes, directing remodeling activity toward specific nucleosome substrates based on their modification state. Unexpectedly, we discover the nucleosome acidic patch3 as necessary for maximum activity of all ISWI remodelers evaluated. We find this dependence also extends to CHD and SWI/SNF family remodelers, suggesting the acidic patch may be generally required for chromatin remodeling. Critically, we observe that remodeling activity can be regulated by modifications neighboring the acidic patch, signifying it may act as a tunable interaction hotspot for ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers and, by extension, many other chromatin effectors that engage this region of the nucleosome surface4-9.},

abstract = {Background . Large-scale bisulfite treatment and short reads sequencing technology allow comprehensive estimation of methylation states of Cs in the genomes of different tissues, cell types, and developmental stages. Accurate characterization of DNA methylation is essential for understanding genotype phenotype association, gene and environment interaction, diseases, and cancer. Aligning bisulfite short reads to a reference genome has been a challenging task. We compared five bisulfite short read mapping tools, BSMAP, Bismark, BS-Seeker, BiSS, and BRAT-BW, representing two classes of mapping algorithms (hash table and suffix/prefix tries). We examined their mapping efficiency (i.e., the percentage of reads that can be mapped to the genomes), usability, running time, and effects of changing default parameter settings using both real and simulated reads. We also investigated how preprocessing data might affect mapping efficiency. Conclusion . Among the five programs compared, in terms of mapping efficiency, Bismark performs the best on the real data, followed by BiSS, BSMAP, and finally BRAT-BW and BS-Seeker with very similar performance. If CPU time is not a constraint, Bismark is a good choice of program for mapping bisulfite treated short reads. Data quality impacts a great deal mapping efficiency. Although increasing the number of mismatches allowed can increase mapping efficiency, it not only significantly slows down the program, but also runs the risk of having increased false positives. Therefore, users should carefully set the related parameters depending on the quality of their sequencing data.},

abstract = {The methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3)-containing methyltransferase complex catalyzes the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) formation, a novel epitranscriptomic marker; however, the nature of this complex remains largely unknown. Here we report two new components of the human m6A methyltransferase complex, Wilms' tumor 1-associating protein (WTAP) and methyltransferase like 14 (METTL14). WTAP interacts with METTL3 and METTL14, and is required for their localization into nuclear speckles enriched with pre-mRNA processing factors and for catalytic activity of the m6A methyltransferase in vivo. The majority of RNAs bound by WTAP and METTL3 in vivo represent mRNAs containing the consensus m6A motif. In the absence of WTAP, the RNA-binding capability of METTL3 is strongly reduced, suggesting that WTAP may function to regulate recruitment of the m6A methyltransferase complex to mRNA targets. Furthermore, transcriptomic analyses in combination with photoactivatable-ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) illustrate that WTAP and METTL3 regulate expression and alternative splicing of genes involved in transcription and RNA processing. Morpholino-mediated knockdown targeting WTAP and/or METTL3 in zebrafish embryos caused tissue differentiation defects and increased apoptosis. These findings provide strong evidence that WTAP may function as a regulatory subunit in the m6A methyltransferase complex and play a critical role in epitranscriptomic regulation of RNA metabolism.},

abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs) arise during post-transcriptional processes, in which a single-stranded RNA molecule forms a circle through covalent binding. Previously, circRNA products were often regarded to be splicing intermediates, by-products, or products of aberrant splicing. But recently, rapid advances in high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) for global investigation of nonco-linear (NCL) RNAs, which comprised sequence segments that are topologically inconsistent with the reference genome, leads to renewed interest in this type of NCL RNA (i.e., circRNA), especially exonic circRNAs (ecircRNAs). Although the biogenesis and function of ecircRNAs are mostly unknown, some ecircRNAs are abundant, highly expressed, or evolutionarily conserved. Some ecircRNAs have been shown to affect microRNA regulation, and probably play roles in regulating parental gene transcription, cell proliferation, and RNA-binding proteins, indicating their functional potential for development as diagnostic tools. To date, thousands of ecircRNAs have been identified in multiple tissues/cell types from diverse species, through analyses of RNA-seq data. However, the detection of ecircRNA candidates involves several major challenges, including discrimination between ecircRNAs and other types of NCL RNAs (e.g., trans-spliced RNAs and genetic rearrangements); removal of sequencing errors, alignment errors, and in vitro artifacts; and the reconciliation of heterogeneous results arising from the use of different bioinformatics methods or sequencing data generated under different treatments. Such challenges may severely hamper the understanding of ecircRNAs. Herein, we review the biogenesis, identification, properties, and function of ecircRNAs, and discuss some unanswered questions regarding ecircRNAs. We also evaluate the accuracy (in terms of sensitivity and precision) of some well-known circRNA-detecting methods.},

abstract = {Epigenetics is the study of biochemical modifications carrying information independent of DNA sequence, which are heritable through cell division. In 1940, Waddington coined the term "epigenetic landscape" as a metaphor for pluripotency and differentiation, but methylation landscapes have not yet been rigorously computed. Using principles from statistical physics and information theory, we derive epigenetic energy landscapes from whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data that enable us to quantify methylation stochasticity genome-wide using Shannon's entropy, associating it with chromatin structure. Moreover, we consider the Jensen-Shannon distance between sample-specific energy landscapes as a measure of epigenetic dissimilarity and demonstrate its effectiveness for discerning epigenetic differences. By viewing methylation maintenance as a communications system, we introduce methylation channels and show that higher-order chromatin organization can be predicted from their informational properties. Our results provide a fundamental understanding of the information-theoretic nature of the epigenome that leads to a powerful approach for studying its role in disease and aging.},

abstract = {It is uncertain whether the vitamin D status of pregnant women influences bone mass of their children. Cohort studies have yielded conflicting results; none have examined offspring at skeletal maturity. This longitudinal, prospective study investigated the association between maternal vitamin D status and peak bone mass of offspring in 341 mother and offspring pairs in the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study. Maternal serum samples collected at 18 weeks gestation were assayed for 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD). Outcomes were total body bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in offspring at 20 years of age. The mean (± SD) maternal serum 25OHD concentration was 57.2 ± 19.2 nmol/L; 132 women (38.7{\%}) were vitamin D-deficient (25OHD {\textless}50 nmol/L). After adjustment for season of sample collection, maternal factors, and offspring factors (sex, birth weight, and age, height, lean mass, and fat mass at 20 years), maternal 25OHD concentration was positively associated with total body BMC and BMD in offspring, with a mean difference of 19.2 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 5.6-32.7) g for BMC and 4.6 (95{\%} CI, 0.1-9.1) mg/cm(2) for BMD per 10.0 nmol/L of maternal 25OHD. Maternal vitamin D deficiency was associated with 2.7{\%} lower total body BMC (mean ± SE) (2846 ± 20 versus 2924 ± 16 g, p = 0.004) and 1.7{\%} lower total body BMD (1053 ± 7 versus 1071 ± 5 mg/cm(2) , p = 0.043) in the offspring. We conclude that vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women is associated with lower peak bone mass in their children. This may increase fracture risk in the offspring in later life. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.},

Here we report global Pol III expression/methylation profiles and molecular mechanisms of Pol III regulation that have not been as extensively studied, using nc886 as a representative Pol III gene. In a human mammary epithelial cell system that recapitulates early breast tumorigenesis, the fraction of actively transcribed Pol III genes increases reaching a plateau during immortalization. Hyper-methylation of Pol III genes inhibits Pol III binding to DNA via inducing repressed chromatin and is a determinant for the Pol III repertoire. When Pol III genes are hypo-methylated, MYC amplifies their transcription, regardless of its recognition DNA motif. Thus, Pol III expression during tumorigenesis is delineated by methylation and magnified by MYC.},

Over 40 years ago, Jacob and Monod [Genetic regulatory mechanisms in the synthesis of proteins, J. Mol. Biol. 3 (1961) 318] proposed a model for gene regulation, which survives essentially unchanged in contemporary textbooks. It is a cogent depiction of how a set of 'structural' genes may be coordinately transcribed in response to environmental conditions and regulates metabolic events in the cell. In bacteria, the genes required for lactose utilization are negatively regulated when a repressor molecule binds to an upstream cis activated operator. The repressor and its operator together form a genetic switch, the lac operon. The switch functions when inducer molecules alter the conformation of the repressor in a specific manner. In the presence of a particular metabolite, the repressor undergoes a conformational change that reduces its affinity for the operator. The structures of the lac repressor and its complexes with operator DNA and effector molecules have provided a physical platform for visualizing at the molecular level the different conformations the repressor and the molecular basis for the switch. The structures of lac repressor, bound to its operator and inducer, have also been invaluable for interpreting a plethora of biochemical and genetic data.},

The long-lived worms with impaired mitochondria had lower ATP content and oxygen consumption, but differential responses to free-radical and other stresses.

abstract = {Background: Maternal blood folate concentrations during pregnancy have been previously linked with DNA methylation patterns, but this has been done predominantly through observational studies. We showed recently in an epigenetic analysis of the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) of folic acid supplementation specifically in the second and third trimesters (the EpiFASSTT trial) that methylation at some imprinted genes was altered in cord blood samples in response to treatment. Here, we report on epigenome-wide screening using the Illumina EPIC array ({\~{}} 850,000 sites) in these same samples (n = 86). Results: The top-ranked differentially methylated promoter region (DMR) showed a gain in methylation with folic acid (FA) and was located upstream of the imprint regulator ZFP57. Differences in methylation in cord blood between placebo and folic acid treatment groups at this DMR were verified using pyrosequencing. The DMR also gains methylation in maternal blood in response to FA supplementation. We also found evidence of differential methylation at this region in an independent RCT cohort, the AFAST trial. By altering methylation at this region in two model systems in vitro, we further demonstrated that it was associated with ZFP57 transcription levels.

abstract = {It remains challenging to predict regulatory variants in particular tissues or cell types due to highly context-specific gene regulation. By connecting large-scale epigenomic profiles to expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in a wide range of human tissues/cell types, we identify critical chromatin features that predict variant regulatory potential. We present cepip, a joint likelihood framework, for estimating a variant's regulatory probability in a context-dependent manner. Our method exhibits significant GWAS signal enrichment and is superior to existing cell type-specific methods. Furthermore, using phenotypically relevant epigenomes to weight the GWAS single-nucleotide polymorphisms, we improve the statistical power of the gene-based association test.},

abstract = {Motivation: Improvement of sequencing technologies and data processing pipelines is rapidly providing sequencing data, with associated high-level features, of many individual genomes in multiple biological and clinical conditions. They allow for data-driven genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic characterizations, but require state-of-the-art ‘big data' computing strategies, with abstraction levels beyond available tool capabilities.Results: We propose a high-level, declarative GenoMetric Query Language (GMQL) and a toolkit for its use. GMQL operates downstream of raw data preprocessing pipelines and supports queries over thousands of heterogeneous datasets and samples; as such it is key to genomic ‘big data' analysis. GMQL leverages a simple data model that provides both abstractions of genomic region data and associated experimental, biological and clinical metadata and interoperability between many data formats. Based on Hadoop framework and Apache Pig platform, GMQL ensures high scalability, expressivity, flexibility and simplicity of use, as demonstrated by several biological query examples on ENCODE and TCGA datasets.Availability and implementation: The GMQL toolkit is freely available for non-commercial use at http://www.bioinformatics.deib.polimi.it/GMQL/.Contact: marco.masseroli@polimi.itSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {Macroautophagy is an intracellular, vesicle-mediated mechanism for the sequestration and ultimate lysosomal degradation of cytoplasmic proteins, organelles and macromolecules. The macroautophagy process and many of the autophagy-specific (Atg) proteins are remarkably well conserved in higher eukaryotes. In yeast, the Atg1 kinase complex includes Atg1, Atg13, Atg17, and at least four other interacting proteins, some of which are phosphorylated in a TOR-dependent manner, placing the Atg1 signaling complex downstream of a major nutrient-sensing pathway. Atg1 orthologs, including mammalian unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1), have been identified in higher eukaryotes and have been functionally linked to autophagy. This suggests that other components of the Atg1 complex exist in higher eukaryotes. Recently, a putative human Atg13 ortholog, FLJ20698, was identified by gapped-BLAST analysis. We show here that FLJ20698 (Atg13) is a ULK1-interacting phosphoprotein that is essential for macroautophagy. Furthermore, we identify a novel, human Atg13-interacting protein, FLJ11773, which we have termed Atg101. Atg101 is essential for autophagy and interacts with ULK1 in an Atg13-dependent manner. Additionally, we present evidence that intracellular localization of the ULK1 complex is regulated by nutrient conditions. Finally, we demonstrate that Atg101 stabilizes the expression of Atg13 in the cell, suggesting that Atg101 contributes to Atg13 function by protecting Atg13 from proteasomal degradation. Therefore, the identification of the novel protein, Atg101, and the validation of Atg13 and Atg101 as ULK1-interacting proteins, suggests an Atg1 complex is involved in the induction of macroautophagy in mammalian cells.},

From embryonic (E), the four juvenile larval stages (L1-L4) and the gravid adult (A,A+), the selection of defined developmental stages extends to two different preparations of aged nematodes (S10, S12). Some aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activities remain nearly unchanged in all stages up to the adult, some increase continuously during the larval stages and the remaining activities show stage-specific alterations. Upon ageing all activities except the one for tryptophan decrease sharply, tRNA methylase activities increase from E to L4, decrease from L4 to adult and to aged nematodes with only qualitative alterations in substrate specificity. The activity of tubulin: tyrosine ligase exhibits a parallel pattern, while arginyltransferase activity has a plateau between L2 and L4. The results are consistent with the idea of a modulation of protein synthesis and other cellular processes by quantitative activity changes during development and ageing.},

abstract = {The specific and dynamic RNA:RNA interactions between pre-mRNA and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), especially U2, U5, and U6 snRNAs, form the catalytic core and are at the heart of the spliceosome formation. The functionally important regions in the snRNAs correspond to the highly modified regions in snRNAs from human, rat, and plant cells. To better understand the importance of the modifications of snRNAs, we identified and localized the modified nucleotides in the five spliceosomal snRNAs of Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells. Twenty-two modified nucleotides, including base methylations, 2'-O-methylations, and pseudouridines, were found in the five spliceosomal snRNAs. The conservation of modified nucleotides between human and S. pombe snRNAs is striking. In addition, most of the modified nucleotides are in or around positions that form hydrogen bonds with the pre-mRNA or with other snRNAs. The results are consistent with the suggestion that modified nucleotides are clustered around functionally important regions of the spliceosomal snRNAs. These data provide the basis for further functional studies on posttranscriptional modifications in spliceosomal snRNAs.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: RNA-seq has been extensively used for transcriptome study. Quality control (QC) is critical to ensure that RNA-seq data are of high quality and suitable for subsequent analyses. However, QC is a time-consuming and complex task, due to the massive size and versatile nature of RNA-seq data. Therefore, a convenient and comprehensive QC tool to assess RNA-seq quality is sorely needed. RESULTS: We developed the RSeQC package to comprehensively evaluate different aspects of RNA-seq experiments, such as sequence quality, GC bias, polymerase chain reaction bias, nucleotide composition bias, sequencing depth, strand specificity, coverage uniformity and read distribution over the genome structure. RSeQC takes both SAM and BAM files as input, which can be produced by most RNA-seq mapping tools as well as BED files, which are widely used for gene models. Most modules in RSeQC take advantage of R scripts for visualization, and they are notably efficient in dealing with large BAM/SAM files containing hundreds of millions of alignments.

Recent efforts to map DNA methylation across mammalian genomes revealed limited DNA methylation at regulatory regions but widespread methylation in intergenic regions and repeats. This is consistent with the idea that hypermethylation is the default epigenetic state and serves in maintaining genome integrity. DNA methylation patterns at regulatory regions are generally stable, but a minor subset of regulatory regions show variable DNA methylation between cell types, suggesting an additional dynamic component. Such promoter de novo methylation might be involved in the maintenance rather than the initiation of silencing of defined genes during development. How frequently such dynamic methylation occurs, its biological relevance and the pathways involved deserve investigation.},

abstract = {Background: The answer to the question “At what age does aging begin?” is tightly related to the question “Where is the onset of mortality increase with age?” Age affects mortality rates from all diseases differently than it affects mortality rates from nonbiological causes. Mortality increase with age in adult populations has been modeled by many authors, and little attention has been given to mortality decrease with age after birth. Materials and methods: Nonbiological causes are excluded, and the category “all diseases” is studied. It is analyzed in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden during the period 1994–2011, and all possible models are screened. Age trajectories of mortality are analyzed separately: before the age category where mortality reaches its minimal value and after the age category. Results: Resulting age trajectories from all diseases showed a strong minimum, which was hidden in total mortality. The inverse proportion between mortality and age fitted in 54 of 58 cases before mortality minimum. The Gompertz model with two parameters fitted as mortality increased with age in 17 of 58 cases after mortality minimum, and the Gompertz model with a small positive quadratic term fitted data in the remaining 41 cases. The mean age where mortality reached minimal value was 8 (95{\%} confidence interval 7.05–8.95) years. The figures depict an age where the human population has a minimal risk of death from biological causes. Conclusion: Inverse proportion and the Gompertz model fitted data on both sides of the mortality minimum, and three parameters determined the shape of the age–mortality trajectory. Life expectancy should be determined by the two standard Gompertz parameters and also by the single parameter in the model c/x. All-disease mortality represents an alternative tool to study the impact of age. All results are based on published data.},

@article{Maunakea2010,
abstract = {Although it is known that the methylation of DNA in 5' promoters suppresses gene expression, the role of DNA methylation in gene bodies is unclear. In mammals, tissue- and cell type-specific methylation is present in a small percentage of 5' CpG island (CGI) promoters, whereas a far greater proportion occurs across gene bodies, coinciding with highly conserved sequences. Tissue-specific intragenic methylation might reduce, or, paradoxically, enhance transcription elongation efficiency. Capped analysis of gene expression (CAGE) experiments also indicate that transcription commonly initiates within and between genes. To investigate the role of intragenic methylation, we generated a map of DNA methylation from the human brain encompassing 24.7 million of the 28 million CpG sites. From the dense, high-resolution coverage of CpG islands, the majority of methylated CpG islands were shown to be in intragenic and intergenic regions, whereas less than 3{\%} of CpG islands in 5' promoters were methylated. The CpG islands in all three locations overlapped with RNA markers of transcription initiation, and unmethylated CpG islands also overlapped significantly with trimethylation of H3K4, a histone modification enriched at promoters. The general and CpG-island-specific patterns of methylation are conserved in mouse tissues. An in-depth investigation of the human SHANK3 locus and its mouse homologue demonstrated that this tissue-specific DNA methylation regulates intragenic promoter activity in vitro and in vivo. These methylation-regulated, alternative transcripts are expressed in a tissue- and cell type-specific manner, and are expressed differentially within a single cell type from distinct brain regions. These results support a major role for intragenic methylation in regulating cell context-specific alternative promoters in gene bodies.},

abstract = {Cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate (di-GMP) is a circular RNA dinucleotide that functions as a second messenger in diverse species of bacteria to trigger wide-ranging physiological changes, including cell differentiation, conversion between motile and biofilm lifestyles, and virulence gene expression. However, the mechanisms by which cyclic di-GMP regulates gene expression have remained a mystery. We found that cyclic di-GMP in many bacterial species is sensed by a riboswitch class in messenger RNA that controls the expression of genes involved in numerous fundamental cellular processes. A variety of cyclic di-GMP regulons are revealed, including some riboswitches associated with virulence gene expression, pilus formation, and flagellum biosynthesis. In addition, sequences matching the consensus for cyclic di-GMP riboswitches are present in the genome of a bacteriophage.},

However, recent technological advances are now allowing cancer epigenetics to be studied genome-wide - an approach that has already begun to provide both biological insight and new avenues for translational research.

@article{Vilfan2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs) are photonic nanostructures that create highly confined optical observation volumes, thereby allowing single-molecule-resolved biophysical studies at relatively high concentrations of fluorescent molecules. This principle has been successfully applied in single-molecule, real-time (SMRT{\textregistered}) DNA sequencing for the detection of DNA sequences and DNA base modifications. In contrast, RNA sequencing methods cannot provide sequence and RNA base modifications concurrently as they rely on complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis by reverse transcription followed by sequencing of cDNA. Thus, information on RNA modifications is lost during the process of cDNA synthesis. RESULTS: Here we describe an application of SMRT technology to follow the activity of reverse transcriptase enzymes synthesizing cDNA on thousands of single RNA templates simultaneously in real time with single nucleotide turnover resolution using arrays of ZMWs. This method thereby obtains information from the RNA template directly. The analysis of the kinetics of the reverse transcriptase can be used to identify RNA base modifications, shown by example for N6-methyladenine (m6A) in oligonucleotides and in a specific mRNA extracted from total cellular mRNA. Furthermore, the real-time reverse transcriptase dynamics informs about RNA secondary structure and its rearrangements, as demonstrated on a ribosomal RNA and an mRNA template. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the feasibility of studying RNA modifications and RNA structural rearrangements in ZMWs in real time. In addition, they suggest that technology can be developed for direct RNA sequencing provided that the reverse transcriptase is optimized to resolve homonucleotide stretches in RNA.},

abstract = {Cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) is a ubiquitous bacterial second messenger that controls the switch from a single-cell lifestyle to surface-attached, multicellular communities called biofilms. PilZ domain proteins are a family of bacterial c-di-GMP receptors, which control various cellular processes. We have solved the solution structure of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa single-domain PilZ protein PA4608 in complex with c-di-GMP by NMR spectroscopy. Isotope labeling by (13)C and (15)N of both the ligand and the protein made it possible to define the structure of c-di-GMP in the complex at high precision by a large number of intermolecular and intraligand NOEs and by two intermolecular hydrogen bond scalar couplings. Complex formation induces significant rearrangements of the C- and N-terminal parts of PA4608. c-di-GMP binds as an intercalated, symmetric dimer to one side of the $\beta$-barrel, thereby displacing the C-terminal helix of the apo state. The N-terminal RXXXR PilZ domain motif, which is flexible in the apo state, wraps around the ligand and in turn ties the displaced C terminus in a loose manner by a number of hydrophobic contacts. The recognition of the dimeric ligand is achieved by numerous H-bonds and stacking interactions involving residues Arg(8), Arg(9), Arg(10), and Arg(13) of the PilZ motif, as well as $\beta$-barrel residues Asp(35) and Trp(77). As a result of the rearrangement of the N and C termini, a highly negative surface is created on one side of the protein complex. We propose that the movement of the termini and the resulting negative surface form the basis for downstream signaling.},

abstract = {Ultra-deep RNA sequencing has become a powerful approach for genome-wide analysis of pre-mRNA alternative splicing. We develop MATS (multivariate analysis of transcript splicing), a bayesian statistical framework for flexible hypothesis testing of differential alternative splicing patterns on RNA-Seq data. MATS uses a multivariate uniform prior to model the between-sample correlation in exon splicing patterns, and a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method coupled with a simulation-based adaptive sampling procedure to calculate the P-value and false discovery rate (FDR) of differential alternative splicing. Importantly, the MATS approach is applicable to almost any type of null hypotheses of interest, providing the flexibility to identify differential alternative splicing events that match a given user-defined pattern. We evaluated the performance of MATS using simulated and real RNA-Seq data sets. In the RNA-Seq analysis of alternative splicing events regulated by the epithelial-specific splicing factor ESRP1, we obtained a high RT-PCR validation rate of 86{\%} for differential exon skipping events with a MATS FDR of {\textless}10{\%}. Additionally, over the full list of RT-PCR tested exons, the MATS FDR estimates matched well with the experimental validation rate. Our results demonstrate that MATS is an effective and flexible approach for detecting differential alternative splicing from RNA-Seq data.},

abstract = {Cellular senescence is a state of irreversible growth arrest characterized by hypertrophy and secretion of various bioactive molecules, a phenomenon defined the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP). Senescent cells are implicated in a number of biological functions, from embryogenesis to aging. Significantly, excessive accumulation of senescent cells is associated to a decline of regenerative capacity and chronic inflammation. In accordance, the removal of senescent cells is sufficient to delay several pathologies and promote healthspan. Calorie restriction (CR) without malnutrition is currently the most effective non-genetic intervention to delay aging phenotypes. Recently, we have shown that CR can prevent accumulation of senescent cells in both mice and humans. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on the molecular and cellular events associated with CR, and define how these events can interfere with the induction of cellular senescence. We discuss the potential side effects of preventing senescence, and the possible alternative dietary interventions with potential senolytic properties.},

Traditionally, a different tool is used for each operation, such as quality control, adapter trimming and quality filtering.

Reading and loading data multiple times also renders preprocessing slow and I/O inefficient.

It can perform quality control, adapter trimming, quality filtering, per-read quality pruning and many other operations with a single scan of the FASTQ data. This tool is developed in C++ and has multi-threading support.

abstract = {The physical nature of the bacterial cytoplasm is poorly understood even though it determines cytoplasmic dynamics and hence cellular physiology and behavior. Through single-particle tracking of protein filaments, plasmids, storage granules, and foreign particles of different sizes, we find that the bacterial cytoplasm displays properties that are characteristic of glass-forming liquids and changes from liquid-like to solid-like in a component size-dependent fashion. As a result, the motion of cytoplasmic components becomes disproportionally constrained with increasing size. Remarkably, cellular metabolism fluidizes the cytoplasm, allowing larger components to escape their local environment and explore larger regions of the cytoplasm. Consequently, cytoplasmic fluidity and dynamics dramatically change as cells shift between metabolically active and dormant states in response to fluctuating environments. Our findings provide insight into bacterial dormancy and have broad implications to our understanding of bacterial physiology, as the glassy behavior of the cytoplasm impacts all intracellular processes involving large components.},

Most, perhaps all, CGIs are sites of transcription initiation, including thousands that are remote from currently annotated promoters. Shared DNA sequence features adapt CGIs for promoter function by destabilizing nucleosomes and attracting proteins that create a transcriptionally permissive chromatin state.

abstract = {Although Darwin insisted that human intelligence could be fully explained by the theory of evolution, the codiscoverer of natural selection, Alfred Russel Wallace, claimed that abstract intelligence was of no use to ancestral humans and could only be explained by intelligent design. Wallace's apparent paradox can be dissolved with two hypotheses about human cognition. One is that intelligence is an adaptation to a knowledge-using, socially interdependent lifestyle, the "cognitive niche." This embraces the ability to overcome the evolutionary fixed defenses of plants and animals by applications of reasoning, including weapons, traps, coordinated driving of game, and detoxification of plants. Such reasoning exploits intuitive theories about different aspects of the world, such as objects, forces, paths, places, states, substances, and other people's beliefs and desires. The theory explains many zoologically unusual traits in Homo sapiens, including our complex toolkit, wide range of habitats and diets, extended childhoods and long lives, hypersociality, complex mating, division into cultures, and language (which multiplies the benefit of knowledge because know-how is useful not only for its practical benefits but as a trade good with others, enhancing the evolution of cooperation). The second hypothesis is that humans possess an ability of metaphorical abstraction, which allows them to coopt faculties that originally evolved for physical problem-solving and social coordination, apply them to abstract subject matter, and combine them productively. These abilities can help explain the emergence of abstract cognition without supernatural or exotic evolutionary forces and are in principle testable by analyses of statistical signs of selection in the human genome.},

abstract = {SUMMARY Hip geometry measurements of outer diameter and buckling ratio at the intertrochanter and shaft of the hip dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan predicted incident hip fracture in postmenopausal women. These associations, independent of age, body size, clinical risk factors, and conventional areal bone mineral density, suggest hip geometry plays a role in fracture etiology and may aid in improving identification of older women at high fracture risk. INTRODUCTION This study examined whether hip geometry parameters predicted hip fracture independent of body size, clinical risk factors, and conventional femoral neck bone mineral density (aBMD) and whether summary factors could be identified to predict hip fracture. METHODS We studied 10,290 postmenopausal women from the Women's Health Initiative. Eight thousand eight hundred forty-three remained fracture free during follow-up to 11 years of follow-up, while 147 fractured their hip, and 1,300 had other clinical fractures. Hip structural analysis software measured bone cross-sectional area, outer diameter, section modulus, average cortical thickness, and buckling ratio on archived DXA scans in three hip regions: narrow neck, intertrochanter, and shaft. Hazard ratios were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models for individual parameters and for composite factors extracted from principal components analysis from all 15 parameters. RESULTS After adjustment for age, body size, clinical risk factors, and aBMD, intertrochanter and shaft outer diameter measurements remained independent predictors of hip fracture with hazard ratios for a one standard deviation increase of 1.61 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 1.25-2.08) for the intertrochanter and 1.36 (95{\%} CI, 1.06-1.76) for the shaft. Average buckling ratios also independently predicted incident hip fracture with hazard ratios of 1.43 (95{\%} CI, 1.10-1.87) at the intertrochanter and 1.24 (95{\%} CI, 1.00-1.55) at the shaft. Although two composite factors were extracted from principal components analysis, neither was superior to these individual measurements at predicting incident hip fracture. CONCLUSIONS Two hip geometry parameters, intertrochanter outer diameter and buckling ratio, predict incident hip fracture after accounting for clinical risk factors and aBMD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Advancing age progressively impacts on risk and severity of chronic disease. It also modifies the epigenome, with changes in DNA methylation, due to both random drift and variation within specific functional loci. RESULTS In a discovery set of 2238 peripheral-blood genome-wide DNA methylomes aged 19-82 years, we identify 71 age-associated differentially methylated regions within the linkage disequilibrium blocks of the single nucleotide polymorphisms from the NIH genome-wide association study catalogue. This included 52 novel regions, 29 within loci not covered by 450 k or 27 k Illumina array, and with enrichment for DNase-I Hypersensitivity sites across the full range of tissues. These age-associated differentially methylated regions also show marked enrichment for enhancers and poised promoters across multiple cell types. In a replication set of 2084 DNA methylomes, 95.7 {\%} of the age-associated differentially methylated regions showed the same direction of ageing effect, with 80.3 {\%} and 53.5 {\%} replicated to p {\textless} 0.05 and p {\textless} 1.85 × 10-8, respectively. CONCLUSION By analysing the functionally enriched disease and trait-associated regions of the human genome, we identify novel epigenetic ageing changes, which could be useful biomarkers or provide mechanistic insights into age-related common diseases.},

abstract = {Polyubiquitination can mediate several different biochemical functions, determined in part by which lysine of ubiquitin is used to link the polyubiquitin chain. Among the HECT domain ubiquitin ligases, some, such as human E6AP, preferentially catalyze the formation of K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, while others, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rsp5 and human Itch, preferentially catalyze the formation of K63-linked chains. The features of HECT E3s that determine their chain type specificities have not been identified. We show here that chain type specificity is a function solely of the Rsp5 HECT domain, that the identity of the cooperating E2 protein does not influence the chain type specificity, that single chains produced by Rsp5 contain between 12 and 30 ubiquitin moieties, and that the determinants of chain type specificity are located within the last 60 amino acids of the C lobe of the HECT domain. Our results are also consistent with a simple sequential-addition mechanism for polyubiquitination by Rsp5, rather than a mechanism involving the formation of either E2- or E3-linked polyubiquitin chain transfers.},

abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a large class of animal RNAs. To investigate possible circRNA functions, it is important to understand circRNA biogenesis. Besides human ALU repeats, sequence features that promote exon circularization are largely unknown. We experimentally identified circRNAs in C. elegans. Reverse complementary sequences between introns bracketing circRNAs were significantly enriched in comparison to linear controls. By scoring the presence of reverse complementary sequences in human introns, we predicted and experimentally validated circRNAs. We show that introns bracketing circRNAs are highly enriched in RNA editing or hyperediting events. Knockdown of the double-strand RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 significantly and specifically upregulated circRNA expression. Together, our data support a model of animal circRNA biogenesis in which competing RNA-RNA interactions of introns form larger structures that promote circularization of embedded exons, whereas ADAR1 antagonizes circRNA expression by melting stems within these interactions.},

abstract = {The retinoblastoma pathway is often inactivated in human tumors resulting in deregulated E2F activity that can induce both proliferation and cell death. Although the role of E2F in apoptosis is well characterized, little is known regarding its putative participation in other cell death pathways. We show here that activation of E2F1 upregulates the expression of four autophagy genes-microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain-3 (LC3), autophagy-related gene-1 (ATG1), ATG5 and damage-regulated autophagy modulator (DRAM). E2F1-mediated induction of LC3, ATG1 and DRAM is direct and indeed, endogenous E2F1 can be found bound to regions encompassing the promoters of these genes. Regulation of ATG5 by E2F1 is indirect. Importantly, we demonstrate that E2F1 activation enhances autophagy and conversely, reducing endogenous E2F1 expression inhibits DNA damage-induced autophagy. These studies identify E2F1 as a transcriptional regulator of autophagy, and for the first time establish a role for E2F1 in DNA damage-induced autophagy.},

abstract = {DNA cytosine methylation is a central epigenetic modification that has essential roles in cellular processes including genome regulation, development and disease. Here we present the first genome-wide, single-base-resolution maps of methylated cytosines in a mammalian genome, from both human embryonic stem cells and fetal fibroblasts, along with comparative analysis of messenger RNA and small RNA components of the transcriptome, several histone modifications, and sites of DNA-protein interaction for several key regulatory factors. Widespread differences were identified in the composition and patterning of cytosine methylation between the two genomes. Nearly one-quarter of all methylation identified in embryonic stem cells was in a non-CG context, suggesting that embryonic stem cells may use different methylation mechanisms to affect gene regulation. Methylation in non-CG contexts showed enrichment in gene bodies and depletion in protein binding sites and enhancers. Non-CG methylation disappeared upon induced differentiation of the embryonic stem cells, and was restored in induced pluripotent stem cells. We identified hundreds of differentially methylated regions proximal to genes involved in pluripotency and differentiation, and widespread reduced methylation levels in fibroblasts associated with lower transcriptional activity. These reference epigenomes provide a foundation for future studies exploring this key epigenetic modification in human disease and development.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Vitamin D regulates 3{\%} of the human genome, including effects on bone health throughout life. Maternal vitamin D status may program neonatal skeletal development. The objective here was to determine the association of mothers' vitamin D status with bone variables of their newborns. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In a birth hospital, pregnant women (n = 125) participated in a cross-sectional study with a longitudinal follow-up of the pregnancy. The mean (sd) values for age, body mass index before pregnancy, pregnancy weight gain, and total vitamin D intake in mothers were 31 (4) yr, 23.5 (3.7) kg/m(2), 13.1 (4.3) kg, and 14.3 (5.8) microg, respectively. All newborns were full-term, 99{\%} were appropriate for gestational age, and 53{\%} were boys. Blood samples were collected from mothers during the first trimester and 2 d postpartum and from umbilical cords at birth for analysis of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (S-25-OHD), PTH, and bone remodeling markers. Bone variables were measured by pQCT at the 20{\%} site of the newborn tibia on an average of 10 (11) d postpartum. Bone contour was analyzed with a single threshold of 180 mg/mm(3) for the detection of total bone mineral density (BMD), bone mineral content (BMC), and cross-sectional area (CSA). RESULTS: Mean S-25-OHD was 41.0 (13.6), 45.1 (11.9), and 50.7 (14.9) nmol/liter during the first trimester, postpartum, and in the umbilical cord, respectively. The median value of the individual means for first trimester and the 2-d postpartum S-25-OHD was 42.6 nmol/liter, which was used as cutoff to define two equal-sized groups. Groups are called below median and above median in the text. Newborns below median were heavier (P = 0.05), and 60{\%} were boys. Tibia bone mineral content was 0.047 (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.011-0.082) g/cm higher (P = 0.01), and cross-sectional area was 12.3 (95{\%} confidence interval, 2.0-22.6) mm(2) larger (P = 0.02), but no difference in bone mineral density was observed, above median compared with below median group. These results were adjusted for newborn Z-score birth weight, maternal height, and newborn age at the measurement. A positive, significant correlation was observed between remodeling markers in mothers at different time points and above median group in the cord. CONCLUSIONS: Although the mean total intake of vitamin D among mothers met current Nordic recommendations, 71{\%} of women and 15{\%} of newborns were vitamin D deficient during the pregnancy. Our results suggest that maternal vitamin D status affects bone mineral accrual during the intrauterine period and influences bone size. More efforts should be made to revise current nutrition recommendations for pregnant women that may have permanent effects on the well-being of children.},

abstract = {Background: The clinical utility of DNA methylation as a predictive or prognostic biomarker requires scalable resequencing protocols for bisulfite-converted DNA. Key features of any validation method should be adaptability for low-or high-throughput needs and high reproducibility, and should only require minimal amounts of precious clinical sample as input material. Critically, this method should also deliver robust results when working with bisulfite-converted DNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks. Results: We report here for the first time on comparison studies between the Fluidigm Access Array system and multiplex assays for multiplex bisulfite PCR resequencing. The requirement of the Fluidigm Access Array system for high template amounts and its sensitivity to variations in template quality rendered it unsuitable for bisulfite PCR applications utilizing FFPE DNA. In response to this limitation, we established a multiplex bisulfite PCR assay capable of delivering robust methylation data using minimal amounts of FFPE clinical DNA. To evaluate the parameters and reproducibility of this assay, 57 amplicons were used to prepare sequencing libraries in triplicate for 13 FFPE tumour samples, as well as a series of 5 methylated controls (0{\%}, 25{\%}, 50{\%}, 75{\%}, and 100{\%}). Analysis of this data demonstrated that this multiplex assay had high reproducibility (mean standard deviation of 1.4{\%} for methylation values), was low cost, required low sample input (50 ng of DNA or less), and could be scaled for both low-and high-throughput needs. Notably, ExoSAP-IT (exonuclease I) treatment to remove residual primers in bisulfite resequencing libraries appeared to degrade the library and generate a high-molecular weight smear which may impact on the degree of methylation assessed. Conclusions: Multiplex bisulfite PCR assays represent a convenient and scalable method for validation and screening of methylated DNA regions from archival FFPE DNA. Moreover, the library construction process detailed here can be rapidly optimized and implemented with a minimal amount of work, can be performed using the standard equipment found in any molecular biology laboratory, and can be easily adapted for use on both genomic DNA and bisulfite DNA applications. However, in preparing bisulfite libraries for sequencing, the use of ExoSAP-IT is not recommended due to potential off-target nuclease effects which may impact downstream methylation analysis.},

abstract = {DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark at the interface of genetic and environmental factors relevant to human disease. Quantitative assessments of global DNA methylation levels have therefore become important tools in epidemiology research, particularly for understanding effects of environmental exposures in complex diseases. Among the available methods of quantitative DNA methylation measurements, bisulfite sequencing is considered the gold standard, but whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) has previously been considered too costly for epidemiology studies with high sample numbers. Pyrosequencing of repetitive sequences within bisulfite-treated DNA has been routinely used as a surrogate for global DNA methylation, but a comparison of pyrosequencing to WGBS for accuracy and reproducibility of methylation levels has not been performed. This study compared the global methylation levels measured from uniquely mappable (non-repetitive) WGBS sequences to pyrosequencing assays of several repeat sequences and repeat assay-matched WGBS data and determined uniquely mappable WGBS data to be the most reproducible and accurate measurement of global DNA methylation levels. We determined sources of variation in repetitive pyrosequencing assays to be PCR amplification bias, PCR primer selection bias in methylation levels of targeted sequences, and inherent variability in methylation levels of repeat sequences. Low-coverage, uniquely mappable WGBS showed the strongest correlation between replicates of all assays. By using multiplexing by indexed bar codes, the cost of WGBS can be lowered significantly to improve the accuracy of global DNA methylation assessments for human studies.},

abstract = {The modified base, 5-methylcytosine, constitutes approximately 1{\%} of human DNA, but sites containing 5-methylcytosine account for at least 30{\%} of all germline and somatic point mutations. A genetic assay with a sensitivity of 1 in 10(7), based on reversion to neomycin resistance of a mutant pSV2-neo plasmid, was utilized to determine and compare the deamination rates of 5-methylcytosine and cytosine in double-stranded DNA for the first time. The rate constants for spontaneous hydrolytic deamination of 5-methylcytosine and cytosine in double-stranded DNA at 37 degrees C were 5.8 x 10(-13) s-1 and 2.6 x 10(-13) s-1, respectively. These rates are more than sufficient to explain the observed frequency of mutation at sites containing 5-methylcytosine and emphasize the importance of hydrolytic deamination as a major source of human mutations.},

abstract = {Mutations can arise from the chance misincorporation of nucleotides during DNA replication or from DNA lesions that are not repaired correctly. We introduce a model that relates the source of mutations to their accumulation with cell divisions, providing a framework for understanding how mutation rates depend on sex, age and absolute time. We show that the accrual of mutations should track cell divisions not only when mutations are replicative in origin but also when they are non-replicative and repaired efficiently. One implication is that the higher incidence of cancer in rapidly renewing tissues, an observation ascribed to replication errors, could instead reflect exogenous or endogenous mutagens. We further find that only mutations that arise from inefficiently repaired lesions will accrue according to absolute time; thus, in the absence of selection on mutation rates, the phylogenetic "molecular clock" should not be expected to run steadily across species.},

abstract = {Mitochondria are eukaryotic organelles that generate most of the energy in the cell by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Each mitochondrion contains multiple copies of a closed circular double-stranded DNA genome (mtDNA). Human (mammalian) mtDNA encodes 13 essential subunits of the inner membrane complex responsible for OXPHOS. These mRNAs are translated by the mitochondrial protein synthesis machinery, which uses the 22 species of mitochondrial tRNAs (mt tRNAs) encoded by mtDNA. The unique structural features of mt tRNAs distinguish them from cytoplasmic tRNAs bearing the canonical cloverleaf structure. The genes encoding mt tRNAs are highly susceptible to point mutations, which are a primary cause of mitochondrial dysfunction and are associated with a wide range of pathologies. A large number of nuclear factors involved in the biogenesis and function of mt tRNAs have been identified and characterized, including processing endonucleases, tRNA-modifying enzymes, and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. These nuclear factors are also targets of pathogenic mutations linked to various diseases, indicating the functional importance of mt tRNAs for mitochondrial activity.},

abstract = {Aging causes epigenetic modifications, which are utilized as a biomarker for the aging process. While genome-wide DNA methylation profiles enable robust age-predictors by integration of many age-associated CG dinucleotides (CpGs), there are various alternative approaches for targeted measurements at specific CpGs that better support standardized and cost-effective high-throughput analysis. In this study, we utilized 4,650 Illumina BeadChip datasets of blood to select the best suited CpG sites for targeted analysis. DNA methylation analysis at these sites with either pyrosequencing or droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) revealed a high correlation with chronological age. In comparison, bisulfite barcoded amplicon sequencing (BBA-seq) gave slightly lower precision at individual CpGs. However, BBA-seq data revealed that the correlation of methylation levels with age at neighboring CpG sites follows a bell-shaped curve, often accompanied by a CTCF binding site at the peak. We demonstrate that within individual BBA-seq reads the DNA methylation at neighboring CpGs is not coherently modified but reveals a stochastic pattern. Based on this, we have developed an alternative model for epigenetic age predictions based on the binary sequel of methylated and non-methylated sites in individual reads, which reflects heterogeneity in epigenetic aging within a sample. Thus, the stochastic evolution of age-associated DNA methylation patterns, which seems to resemble epigenetic drift, enables epigenetic clocks for individual DNA strands.},

abstract = {Background: Primary cells enter replicative senescence after a limited number of cell divisions. This process needs to be considered in cell culture experiments, and it is particularly important for regenerative medicine. Replicative senescence is associated with reproducible changes in DNA methylation (DNAm) at specific sites in the genome. The mechanism that drives senescence-associated DNAm changes remains unknown - it may involve stochastic DNAm drift due to imperfect maintenance of epigenetic marks or it is directly regulated at specific sites in the genome. Results: In this study, we analyzed the reorganization of nuclear architecture and DNAm changes during long-term culture of human fibroblasts and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). We demonstrate that telomeres shorten and shift towards the nuclear center at later passages. In addition, DNAm profiles, either analyzed by MethylCap-seq or by 450k IlluminaBeadChip technology, revealed consistent senescence-associated hypermethylation in regions associated with H3K27me3, H3K4me3, and H3K4me1 histone marks, whereas hypomethylation was associated with chromatin containing H3K9me3 and lamina-associated domains (LADs). DNA hypermethylation was significantly enriched in the vicinity of genes that are either up- or downregulated at later passages. Furthermore, specific transcription factor binding motifs (e.g. EGR1, TFAP2A, and ETS1) were significantly enriched in differentially methylated regions and in the promoters of differentially expressed genes. Conclusions: Senescence-associated DNA hypermethylation occurs at specific sites in the genome and reflects functional changes in the course of replicative senescence. These results indicate that tightly regulated epigenetic modifications during long-term culture contribute to changes in nuclear organization and gene expression.},

abstract = {Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems provide bacteria and archaea with adaptive immunity against viruses and plasmids by using CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) to guide the silencing of invading nucleic acids. We show here that in a subset of these systems, the mature crRNA that is base-paired to trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) forms a two-RNA structure that directs the CRISPR-associated protein Cas9 to introduce double-stranded (ds) breaks in target DNA. At sites complementary to the crRNA-guide sequence, the Cas9 HNH nuclease domain cleaves the complementary strand, whereas the Cas9 RuvC-like domain cleaves the noncomplementary strand. The dual-tracrRNA:crRNA, when engineered as a single RNA chimera, also directs sequence-specific Cas9 dsDNA cleavage. Our study reveals a family of endonucleases that use dual-RNAs for site-specific DNA cleavage and highlights the potential to exploit the system for RNA-programmable genome editing.},

abstract = {Aberrant methylation of promoter region CpG islands is associated with transcriptional inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes in neoplasia. To understand global patterns of CpG island methylation in colorectal cancer, we have used a recently developed technique called methylated CpG island amplification to examine 30 newly cloned differ-entially methylated DNA sequences. Of these 30 clones, 19 (63{\%}) were progressively methylated in an age-dependent manner in normal colon, 7 (23{\%}) were methylated in a cancer-specific manner, and 4 (13{\%}) were methylated only in cell lines. Thus, a majority of CpG islands methylated in colon cancer are also methylated in a subset of normal colonic cells during the process of aging. In contrast, methylation of the cancer-specific clones was found exclusively in a subset of colorectal cancers, which appear to display a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). CIMP؉ tumors also have a high incidence of p16 and THBS1 methylation, and they include the majority of sporadic colorectal cancers with microsatellite instability related to hMLH1 methylation. We thus define a pathway in colorectal cancer that appears to be responsible for the majority of sporadic tumors with mis-match repair deficiency. In the development of colorectal cancers (CRCs), a series of tumor-suppressor genes such as APC, p53, and genes on chromosome 18q (DCC, SMAD2, and DPC4͞SMAD4) are inactivated by mutations and chromosomal deletions (1, 2). A subset of CRCs also show a characteristic mutator phenotype which causes microsatellite instability (MSI) and mutations at other gene loci such as TGF␤RII (3) and BAX (4). This phenotype usually results from inactivation of mismatch repair (MMR) genes such as hMSH2 and hMLH1 (5). Another molecular defect described in CRC is CpG island (CGI) methylation. CGIs are short sequences rich in the CpG dinu-cleotide and can be found in the 5Ј region of about half of all human genes (6). Methylation of cytosine within 5Ј CGIs is associated with loss of gene expression and has been seen in physiological conditions such as X chromosome inactivation and genomic imprinting (7). Aberrant methylation of CGIs has been detected in genetic diseases such as the fragile-X syn-drome (8), in aging cells (9), and in neoplasia (10, 11). About half of the tumor-suppressor genes that have been shown to be mutated in the germ line of patients with familial cancer syndromes have also been shown to be aberrantly methylated in some proportion of sporadic cancers, including Rb, VHL, p16, hMLH1, and BRCA1 (10, 11). Tumor-suppressor gene methylation in cancer is usually associated with (i) lack of gene transcription and (ii) absence of coding region mutation. Thus it has been proposed that CGI methylation serves as an alternative mechanism of gene inactivation in cancer. The causes and global patterns of CGI methylation in human cancers remain poorly defined. We have previously reported that aging could play a factor in this process because methyl-ation of several CGIs could be detected in an age-related manner in normal colon mucosa as well as in CRC (9). In addition, aberrant methylation of CGIs has been associated with the MSI phenotype in CRC (12) as well as specific carcinogen exposures (13). However, an understanding of aberrant methylation in CRC has been somewhat limited by the small number of CGIs analyzed to date. We have used a recently developed PCR-based methylation screening tech-nique, methylated CpG island amplification (MCA), to deter-mine the methylation status of multiple CGIs in a relatively large number of samples. In this report, we analyzed the methylation status of 30 new loci and 3 known tumor-suppressor genes in a panel of 50 primary CRCs and 15 colonic adenomas. We find that (i) the majority of CGI methylation events in CRCs are related to incremental hypermethylation in normal colon as an age-related phenomenon; and (ii) virtually all the other methylation events occur in a distinct subset of CRCs and adenomas which appear therefore to have a new phenotype, which we termed CpG island methylator pheno-type (CIMP). These data shed additional light on the global patterns of CGI methylation in human cancer and delineate a distinct pathway involving tumor-suppressor gene hypermeth-ylation in the evolution of CRC.},

A strong candidate is a sequence of the type XppY1mpY2mpZp..., where X represents a blocking group which is itself occasionally methylated. The sequences isolated from total poly(A)+ mRNA contain all four species of 2'-O-methylated nucleoside, indicating some variability among different mRNA species. The methylated sequences do not appear to be enriched in the mRNA which hybridizes with repetitive DNA. The average L cell mRNA molecule also contains three residues of N6-methyl adenine. These residues are not part of the poly(A) segment, but appear to be located internal to the poly(A) near the 3' end of the mRNA molecules.},

abstract = {Methylation of CpG (cytosine-phosphate-guanine) dinucleotides is a common epigenetic mark that influences gene expression. The effects of methylation on transcription factor (TF) binding are unknown for most TFs and, even when known, such knowledge is often only qualitative. In reality, methylation sensitivity is a quantitative effect, just as changes to the DNA sequence have quantitative effects on TF binding affinity. We describe Methyl-Spec-seq, an easy-to-use method that measures the effects of CpG methylation (mCPG) on binding affinity for hundreds to thousands of variants in parallel, allowing one to quantitatively assess the effects at every position in a binding site. We demonstrate its use on several important DNA binding proteins. We calibrate the accuracy of Methyl-Spec-seq using a novel two-color competitive fluorescence anisotropy method that can accurately determine the relative affinities of two sequences in solution. We also present software that extends standard methods for representing, visualizing, and searching for matches to binding site motifs to include the effects of methylation. These tools facilitate the study of the consequences for gene regulation of epigenetic marks on DNA.},

abstract = {Our previous work has shown associations between childhood adiposity and perinatal methylation status of several genes in umbilical cord tissue, including endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). There is increasing evidence that eNOS is important in bone metabolism; we therefore related the methylation status of the eNOS gene promoter in stored umbilical cord to childhood bone size and density in a group of 9-year-old children. We used Sequenom MassARRAY to assess the methylation status of two CpGs in the eNOS promoter, identified from our previous study, in stored umbilical cords of 66 children who formed part of a Southampton birth cohort and who had measurements of bone size and density at age 9 years (Lunar DPXL DXA instrument). Percentage methylation varied greatly between subjects. For one of the two CpGs, eNOS chr7:150315553 + , after taking account of age and sex, there were strong positive associations between methylation status and the child's whole-body bone area (r = 0.28, P = 0.02), bone mineral content (r = 0.34, P = 0.005), and areal bone mineral density (r = 0.34, P = 0.005) at age 9 years. These associations were independent of previously documented maternal determinants of offspring bone mass. Our findings suggest an association between methylation status at birth of a specific CpG within the eNOS promoter and bone mineral content in childhood. This supports a role for eNOS in bone growth and metabolism and implies that its contribution may at least in part occur during early skeletal development.},

abstract = {Autophagy, a cellular catabolic pathway, is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals. Central to this process is the formation of autophagosomes, double-membrane vesicles responsible for delivering long-lived proteins and excess or damaged organelle into the lysosome for degradation and reuse of the resulting macromolecules. In addition to the hallmark discovery of core molecular machinery components involved in autophagosome formation, complex signaling cascades controlling autophagy have also begun to emerge, with mTOR as a central but far from exclusive player. Malfunction of autophagy has been linked to a wide range of human pathologies, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and pathogen infection. Here we highlight the recent advances in identifying and understanding the core molecular machinery and signaling pathways that are involved in mammalian autophagy.},

abstract = {In Escherichia coli, the EnvZ/OmpR two-component regulatory system regulates expression of the porin genes ompF and ompC in response to changes in osmolarity. It has recently become apparent that OmpR functions as a global regulator, by regulating the expression of many genes in addition to the porin genes. OmpR consists of two domains; phosphorylation of the N-terminal receiver domain increases DNA binding affinity of the C-terminal domain and vice versa. Many response regulators including PhoB and FixJ dimerize upon phosphorylation. Here, we demonstrate that OmpR dimerization is stimulated by phosphorylation or by DNA binding. The dimerization interface revealed here was unanticipated and had previously not been predicted. Using the accepted head-to-tail tandem-binding model as a guide, we set out to examine the intermolecular interactions between OmpR dimers bound to DNA by protein-protein cross-linking methods. Surprisingly, amino acid positions that we expected to form cross-linked dimers did not. Conversely, positions predicted not to form dimers did. Because of these results, we designed a series of 23 cysteine-substituted OmpR mutants that were used to investigate dimer interfaces formed via the beta-sheet region. This four-stranded beta-sheet is a unique feature of the OmpR group of winged helix-turn-helix proteins. Many of the cysteine-substituted mutants are dominant to wild-type OmpR, are phosphorylated by acetyl phosphate as well as the cognate kinase EnvZ, and the cross-linked proteins are capable of binding to DNA. Our results are consistent with a model in which OmpR binds to DNA in a head-to-head orientation, in contrast to the previously proposed asymmetric head-to-tail model. They also raise the possibility that OmpR may be capable of adopting more than one orientation as it binds to a vast array of genes to activate or repress transcription.},

abstract = {The evolutionary theories of mutation accumulation (MA) and disposable soma (DS) provide possible explanations for the existence of human aging. To better understand the relative importance of these theories, we devised a test to identify MA- and DS-consistent sites across the genome using familial DNA methylation data. Two key characteristics of DNA methylation allowed us to do so. First, DNA methylation exhibits distinct and widespread changes with age, with numerous age-differentially-methylated sites observed across the genome. Second, many sites show heritable DNA methylation patterns within families. We extended heritability predictions of MA and DS to DNA methylation, predicting that MA-consistent age-differentially-methylated sites will show increasing heritability with age, while DS-consistent sites will show the opposite. Variance components models were used to test for changing heritability of methylation with age at 48,601 age-differentially-methylated sites across the genome in 610 individuals from 176 families. 102 sites showed significant MA-consistent increases in heritability with age, while 2,266 showed significant DS-consistent decreases in heritability. These results suggest that both MA and DS play a role in explaining aging and aging-related changes, and that while the majority of DNA methylation changes observed in aging are consistent with epigenetic drift, targeted changes exist and may mediate effects of aging-related genes.},

abstract = {In recent years salicylic acid (SA) has been the focus of intensive research due to its function as an endogenous signal mediating local and systemic plant defence responses against pathogens. It has also been found that SA plays a role during the plant response to abiotic stresses such as drought, chilling, heavy metal toxicity, heat, and osmotic stress. In this sense, SA appears to be, just like in mammals, an 'effective therapeutic agent' for plants. Besides this function during biotic and abiotic stress, SA plays a crucial role in the regulation of physiological and biochemical processes during the entire lifespan of the plant. The discovery of its targets and the understanding of its molecular modes of action in physiological processes could help in the dissection of the complex SA signalling network, confirming its important role in both plant health and disease. Here, the evidence that supports the role of SA during plant growth and development is reviewed by comparing experiments performed by exogenous application of SA with analysis of genotypes affected by SA levels and/or perception.},

We found that dwarf-derived fibroblasts had higher levels of autophagy, using LC3 and p62 as markers, in response to amino acid deprivation, hydrogen peroxide, and paraquat. Fibroblasts from dwarf mice also showed diminished phosphorylation of mTOR, S6K, and 4EBP1, consistent with the higher levels of autophagy in these cells after stress. Similar results were also observed in fibroblasts from mutant mice lacking growth hormone receptor (GHRKO mice) after amino acid withdrawal. Our results suggested that increased autophagy, regulated by TOR-dependent processes, may contribute to stress resistance in fibroblasts from long-lived mutant mice.},

abstract = {DNA methylation is a heritable epigenetic mark, enabling stable but reversible gene repression. In mammalian cells, DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are responsible for modifying cytosine to 5-methylcytosine (5mC), which can be further oxidized by the TET dioxygenases to ultimately cause DNA demethylation. However, the genome-wide cooperation and functions of these two families of proteins, especially at large under-methylated regions, called canyons, remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that DNMT3A and TET1 function in a complementary and competitive manner in mouse embryonic stem cells to mediate proper epigenetic landscapes and gene expression. The longer isoform of DNMT3A, DNMT3A1, exhibits significant enrichment at distal promoters and canyon edges, but is excluded from proximal promoters and canyons where TET1 shows prominent binding. Deletion of Tet1 increases DNMT3A1 binding capacity at and around genes with wild-type TET1 binding. However, deletion of Dnmt3a has a minor effect on TET1 binding on chromatin, indicating that TET1 may limit DNA methylation partially by protecting its targets from DNMT3A and establishing boundaries for DNA methylation. Local CpG density may determine their complementary binding patterns and therefore that the methylation landscape is encoded in the DNA sequence. Furthermore, DNMT3A and TET1 impact histone modifications which in turn regulate gene expression. In particular, they regulate Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-mediated H3K27me3 enrichment to constrain gene expression from bivalent promoters. We conclude that DNMT3A and TET1 regulate the epigenome and gene expression at specific targets via their functional interplay.},

Our model resolves the paradox of topological simplification concomitant with chromosome 'condensation', and explains how enzymes a few nanometers in size are able to control chromosome geometry and topology at micron length scales.

abstract = {In eukaryotes, the transcription of tRNA genes is initiated by the concerted action of transcription factors IIIC (TFIIIC) and IIIB (TFIIIB) which direct the recruitment of polymerase III. While TFIIIC recognizes highly conserved, intragenic promoter elements, TFIIIB binds to the non-coding 5'-upstream regions of the tRNA genes. Using a systematic bioinformatic analysis of 11 multicellular eukaryotic genomes we identified a highly conserved TATA motif followed by a CAA-motif in the tRNA upstream regions of all plant genomes. Strikingly, the 5'-flanking tRNA regions of the animal genomes are highly heterogeneous and lack a common conserved sequence signature. Interestingly, in the animal genomes the tRNA species that read the same codon share conserved motifs in their upstream regions. Deep-sequencing analysis of 16 human tissues revealed multiple splicing variants of two of the TFIIIB subunits, Bdp1 and Brf1, with tissue-specific expression patterns. These multiple forms most likely modulate the TFIIIB-DNA interactions and explain the lack of a uniform signature motif in the tRNA upstream regions of animal genomes. The anticodon-dependent 5'-flanking motifs provide a possible mechanism for independent regulation of the tRNA transcription in various human tissues.},

Skeletal size and density increase from early embryogenesis through intrauterine, infant, childhood and adult life to reach a peak in the third to fourth decade. The peak bone mass achieved is a strong predictor of later osteoporosis risk. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a positive relationship between early growth and later bone mass, both at peak and in later life, and also with reduced risk of hip fracture. Mother-offspring cohorts have allowed the elucidation of some of the specific factors in early life, such as maternal body build, lifestyle and 25(OH)-vitamin D status, which might be important. Most recently, the phenomenon of developmental plasticity, whereby a single genotype may give rise to different phenotypes depending on the prevailing environment, and the science of epigenetics have presented novel molecular mechanisms which may underlie previous observations. This review will give an overview of these latter developments in the context of the burden of osteoporosis and the wider data supporting the link between the early environment and bone health in later life. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.},

abstract = {Naked mole rats (NMRs; Heterocephalus glaber) are the longest-living rodents known, with a maximum lifespan of 30 years—5 times longer than expected on the basis of body size. These highly social mouse-sized rodents, naturally found in subterranean burrows in the arid and semiarid re- gions of the horn of Africa, are commonly used in behav- ioral, neurological, and ecophysiological research. Very old NMRs ({\textgreater}28 years), like humans, show signs of age-associ- ated pathologies (e.g., muscle loss) as well as the accumula- tion of lipofuscin pigments, but no signs of tumorigenesis. Indeed, for at least 80{\%} of their lives NMRs maintain nor- mal activity, body composition, and reproductive and physi- ological functions with no obvious age-related increases in morbidity or mortality rate. Their long lifespan is attributed to sustained good health and pronounced cancer resistance. Clearly physiological and biochemical processes in this spe- cies have evolved to dramatically extend both their good health- and lifespan. We and others have tested various cur- rent theories using this species as an exceptionally long-lived animal model of successful abrogated aging. Surprisingly, NMRs have high levels of oxidative stress and relatively short telomeres, yet they are extremely resilient when sub- jected to cellular stressors and appear capable of sustaining both their genomic and protein integrity under hostile condi- tions. The challenge is to understand how these animals are able to do this. Elucidating these mechanisms will provide useful information for enhancing human life- and health- span, making the naked mole rat a true “supermodel” for aging research and resistance to chronic age-associated diseases.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The discovery of fetal DNA in maternal plasma has opened up an approach for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis. Despite the rapid expansion in clinical applications, the molecular characteristics of plasma DNA in pregnant women remain unclear. METHODS: We investigated the size distribution of plasma DNA in 34 nonpregnant women and 31 pregnant women, using a panel of quantitative PCR assays with different amplicon sizes targeting the leptin gene. We also determined the size distribution of fetal DNA in maternal plasma by targeting the SRY gene. RESULTS: The median percentages of plasma DNA with size {\textgreater}201 bp were 57{\%} and 14{\%} for pregnant and nonpregnant women, respectively (P {\textless}0.001, Mann-Whitney test). The median percentages of fetal-derived DNA with sizes {\textgreater}193 bp and {\textgreater}313 bp were 20{\%} and 0{\%}, respectively, in maternal plasma. CONCLUSION: Plasma DNA molecules are mainly short DNA fragments. The DNA fragments in the plasma of pregnant women are significantly longer than those in the plasma of nonpregnant women, and the maternal-derived DNA molecules are longer than the fetal-derived ones.},

A lot of them such as tRNA, 7SL RNA, 7SK RNA, 5S RNA, MRP RNA, Y RNAs, H1 RNA, and vault RNAs are considered as "house keeping" RNAs essential for eukaryotic cells. In recent years, researchers started to recognize the existence of unconventional functions of many pol III transcripts other than classical "house keeping" roles. Therefore, these ncRNAs could now be viewed as molecules with functional regulatory signals as well as cellular building blocks. These noncoding RNAs, all transcribed by pol III, may assemble regulatory networks with analogy to signaling pathways in eukaryotic cells. In this review we discuss these unconventional roles of pol III transcripts.},

A lack of open source tools to process IDAT files has hampered their uptake by the research community beyond the standard step of using the vendor's software to extract the data they contain in a human readable text format. To fill this void, we have developed the illuminaio package that parses IDAT files from any BeadArray platform, including the decryption of files from Illumina's gene expression arrays. illuminaio provides the first open-source package for this task, and will promote wider uptake of the IDAT format as a standard for sharing Illumina BeadArray data in public databases, in the same way that the CEL file serves as the standard for the Affymetrix platform.},

abstract = {Approximately 20{\%} of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS) arises from germ-line mutations in the superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) gene. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the process have been elusive. Here, we show that a neuronal homologous to E6AP carboxyl terminus (HECT)-type ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (NEDL1) physically binds translocon-associated protein-delta and also binds and ubiquitinates mutant (but not wild-type) SOD1 proportionately to the disease severity caused by that particular mutant. Immunohistochemically, NEDL1 is present in the central region of the Lewy body-like hyaline inclusions in the spinal cord ventral horn motor neurons of both FALS patients and mutant SOD1 transgenic mice. Two-hybrid screening for the physiological targets of NEDL1 has identified Dishevelled-1, one of the key transducers in the Wnt signaling pathway. Mutant SOD1 also interacted with Dishevelled-1 in the presence of NEDL1 and caused its dysfunction. Thus, our results suggest that an adverse interaction among misfolded SOD1, NEDL1, translocon-associated protein-delta, and Dishevelled-1 forms a ubiquitinated protein complex that is included in potentially cytotoxic protein aggregates and that mutually affects their functions, leading to motor neuron death in FALS.},

abstract = {Ubiquitination is essential in mediating diverse cellular functions including protein degradation and trafficking. Ubiquitin-protein (E3) ligases determine the substrate specificity of the ubiquitination process. The Nedd4 family of E3 ligases is an evolutionarily conserved family of proteins required for the ubiquitination of a large number of cellular targets. As a result, this family regulates a wide variety of cellular processes including transcription, stability and trafficking of plasma membrane proteins, and the degradation of misfolded proteins. The modular architecture of the proteins, comprising a C2 domain, multiple WW domains and a catalytic domain, enables diverse intermolecular interactions and recruitment to various subcellular locations. The WW domains commonly mediate interaction with substrate proteins; however, an increasing number of Nedd4 targets do not contain obvious WW domain-interaction motifs suggesting the involvement of accessory proteins. This review discusses recent insights into how accessory and adaptor proteins modulate the activities of Nedd4 family members, including recruitment of novel substrates, alteration of subcellular localisation and effects on ubiquitination.},

abstract = {Although yeast RNA polymerase III (Pol III) and the auxiliary factors TFIIIC and TFIIIB are well characterized, the mechanisms of class III gene regulation are poorly understood. Previous studies identified MAF1, a gene that affects tRNA suppressor efficiency and interacts genetically with Pol III. We show here that tRNA levels are elevated in maf1 mutant cells. In keeping with the higher levels of tRNA observed in vivo, the in vitro rate of Pol III RNA synthesis is significantly increased in maf1 cell extracts. Mutations in the RPC160 gene encoding the largest subunit of Pol III which reduce tRNA levels were identified as suppressors of the maf1 growth defect. Interestingly, Maf1p is located in the nucleus and coimmunopurifies with epitope-tagged RNA Pol III. These results indicate that Maf1p acts as a negative effector of Pol III synthesis. This potential regulator of Pol III transcription is likely conserved since orthologs of Maf1p are present in other eukaryotes, including humans.},

abstract = {The post-translational modification of histones and the incorporation of core histone variants play key roles in governing gene expression. Many eukaryotic genes regulate their expression by limiting the escape of RNA polymerase from promoter-proximal pause sites. Here we report that elongating RNA polymerase II complexes encounter distinct chromatin landscapes that are marked by methylation of lysine residues Lys4, Lys79, and Lys36 of histone H3. However, neither histone methylation nor acetylation directly regulates the release of elongation complexes stalled at promoter-proximal pause sites of the c-myc gene. In contrast, transcriptional activation is associated with local displacement of the histone variant H2A.Z within the transcribed region and incorporation of the major histone variant H2A. This result indicates that transcribing RNA polymerase II remodels chromatin in part through coincident displacement of H2A.Z-H2B dimers and incorporation of H2A-H2B dimers. In combination, these results suggest a new model in which the incorporation of H2A.Z into nucleosomes down-regulates transcription; at the same time it may act as a cellular memory for transcriptionally poised gene domains. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {DNA methylation is a major regulatory process of gene transcription, and aberrant DNA methylation is associated with various diseases including cancer. Many compounds have been reported to modify DNA methylation states. Despite increasing interest in the clinical application of drugs with epigenetic effects, and the use of diagnostic markers for genome-wide hypomethylation in cancer, large-scale screening systems to measure the effects of drugs on DNA methylation are limited. In this study, we improved the previously established fluorescence polarization-based global DNA methylation assay so that it is more suitable for application to human genomic DNA. Our methyl-sensitive fluorescence polarization (MSFP) assay was highly repeatable (inter-assay coefficient of variation = 1.5{\%}) and accurate (r2 = 0.99). According to signal linearity, only 50-80 ng human genomic DNA per reaction was necessary for the 384-well format. MSFP is a simple, rapid approach as all biochemical reactions and final detection can be performed in one well in a 384-well plate without purification steps in less than 3.5 hours. Furthermore, we demonstrated a significant correlation between MSFP and the LINE-1 pyrosequencing assay, a widely used global DNA methylation assay. MSFP can be applied for the pre-screening of compounds that influence global DNA methylation states and also for the diagnosis of certain types of cancer.},

Both genes also regulate formation of the dauer larva, a developmentally arrested larval form that is induced by crowding and starvation and is very long-lived. Our findings raise the possibility that the longevity of the dauer is not simply a consequence of its arrested growth, but instead results from a regulated lifespan extension mechanism that can be uncoupled from other aspects of dauer formation. daf-2 and daf-16 provide entry points into understanding how lifespan can be extended.},

By employing machine learning for gene classification, we found that the plasma DNA read depth patterns from healthy donors reflected the expression signature of hematopoietic cells. In patients with cancer having metastatic disease, we were able to classify expressed cancer driver genes in regions with somatic copy number gains with high accuracy. We were able to determine the expressed isoform of genes with several TSSs, as confirmed by RNA-seq analysis of the matching primary tumor.

This hypothesis is gaining strength due to findings that indicate involvement of Alu elements in a variety of functions; for example, Alu sequences were found to contain several functional transcription factor (TF) binding sites (BSs). We performed a search for new putative BSs on Alu elements, using a database of Position Specific Score Matrices (PSSMs). We searched consensus Alu sequences as well as specific Alu elements that appear on the 5 Kbp regions upstream to the transcription start site (TSS) of about 14000 genes. RESULTS We found that the upstream regions of the TSS are enriched with Alu elements, and the Alu consensus sequences contain dozens of putative BSs for TFs. Hence several TFs have Alu-associated BSs upstream of the TSS of many genes. For several TFs most of the putative BSs reside on Alu; a few of these were previously found and their association with Alu was also reported. In four cases the fact that the identified BSs resided on Alu went unnoticed, and we report this association for the first time. We found dozens of new putative BSs. Interestingly, many of the corresponding TFs are associated with early markers of development, even though the upstream regions of development-related genes are Alu-poor, compared with translational and protein biosynthesis related genes, which are Alu-rich. Finally, we found a correlation between the mouse B1 and human Alu densities within the corresponding upstream regions of orthologous genes. CONCLUSION We propose that evolution used transposable elements to insert TF binding motifs into promoter regions. We observed enrichment of biosynthesis genes with Alu-associated BSs of developmental TFs. Since development and cell proliferation (of which biosynthesis is an essential component) were proposed to be opposing processes, these TFs possibly play inhibitory roles, suppressing proliferation during differentiation.},

Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration (25OHD) is a useful risk marker of clinical vitamin D deficiency. This review summarizes the factors that contribute to differences in 25OHD among populations and provides an overview of the prevalence of low vitamin D status worldwide. It discusses the controversies that surround the interpretation of 25OHD, other proposed indices of vitamin D adequacy and dietary reference values for vitamin D, and describes the emerging evidence that a very low calcium intake may contribute to the etiology of rickets in Africa and Asia. There is an urgent need for action to address the global burden of rickets and osteomalacia. {\textcopyright} 2008 International Life Sciences Institute.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The extent to which development- and age-associated epigenetic changes are influenced by genetic, environmental and stochastic factors remains to be discovered. Twins provide an ideal model with which to investigate these influences but previous cross-sectional twin studies provide contradictory evidence of within-pair epigenetic drift over time. Longitudinal twin studies can potentially address this discrepancy. RESULTS In a pilot, genome-scale study of DNA from buccal epithelium, a relatively homogeneous tissue, we show that one-third of the CpGs assayed show dynamic methylation between birth and 18 months. Although all classes of annotated genomic regions assessed show an increase in DNA methylation over time, probes located in intragenic regions, enhancers and low-density CpG promoters are significantly over-represented, while CpG islands and high-CpG density promoters are depleted among the most dynamic probes. Comparison of co-twins demonstrated that within-pair drift in DNA methylation in our cohort is specific to a subset of pairs, who show more differences at 18 months. The rest of the pairs show either minimal change in methylation discordance, or more similar, converging methylation profiles at 18 months. As with age-associated regions, sites that change in their level of within-pair discordance between birth and 18 months are enriched in genes involved in development, but the average magnitude of change is smaller than for longitudinal change. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that DNA methylation in buccal epithelium is influenced by non-shared stochastic and environmental factors that could reflect a degree of epigenetic plasticity within an otherwise constrained developmental program.},

abstract = {An outstanding challenge of Epigenome-Wide Association Studies (EWAS) performed in complex tissues is the identification of the specific cell-type(s) responsible for the observed differential DNA methylation. Here, we present a novel statistical algorithm, called CellDMC, which is able to identify not only differentially methylated positions, but also the specific cell-type(s) driving the differential methylation. We provide extensive validation of CellDMC on in-silico mixtures of DNA methylation data generated with different technologies, as well as on real mixtures from epigenome-wide-association and cancer epigenome studies. We demonstrate how CellDMC can achieve over 90{\%} sensitivity and specificity in scenarios where current state-of-the-art methods fail to identify differential methylation. By applying CellDMC to a smoking EWAS performed in buccal swabs, we identify differentially methylated positions occurring in the epithelial compartment, which we validate in smoking-related lung cancer.

abstract = {Classical evolutionary theory maintains that mutation rate variation between genes should be random with respect to fitness and evolutionary optimization of genic mutation rates remains controversial. However, it has now become known that cytogenetic (DNA sequence + epigenomic) features influence local mutation probabilities, which is predicted by more recent theory to be a prerequisite for beneficial mutation rates between different classes of genes to readily evolve. To test this possibility, we used de novo mutations in Arabidopsis thaliana to create a high resolution predictive model of mutation rates as a function of cytogenetic features across the genome. As expected, mutation rates are significantly predicted by features such as GC content, histone modifications, and chromatin accessibility. Deeper analyses of predicted mutation rates reveal effects of introns and untranslated exon regions in distancing coding sequences from mutational hotspots at the start and end of transcribed regions in A. thaliana . Finally, predicted coding region mutation rates are significantly lower in genes where mutations are more likely to be deleterious, supported by numerous estimates of evolutionary and functional constraint. These findings contradict neutral expectations that mutation probabilities are independent of fitness consequences. Instead they are consistent with the evolution of lower mutation rates in functionally constrained loci due to cytogenetic features, with important implications for evolutionary biology.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Local intramuscular administration of the antisense oligonucleotide PRO051 in patients with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy with relevant mutations was previously reported to induce the skipping of exon 51 during pre-messenger RNA splicing of the dystrophin gene and to facilitate new dystrophin expression in muscle-fiber membranes. The present phase 1-2a study aimed to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and molecular and clinical effects of systemically administered PRO051. METHODS: We administered weekly abdominal subcutaneous injections of PRO051 for 5 weeks in 12 patients, with each of four possible doses (0.5, 2.0, 4.0, and 6.0 mg per kilogram of body weight) given to 3 patients. Changes in RNA splicing and protein levels in the tibialis anterior muscle were assessed at two time points. All patients subsequently entered a 12-week open-label extension phase, during which they all received PRO051 at a dose of 6.0 mg per kilogram per week. Safety, pharmacokinetics, serum creatine kinase levels, and muscle strength and function were assessed. RESULTS: The most common adverse events were irritation at the administration site and, during the extension phase, mild and variable proteinuria and increased urinary $\alpha$(1)-microglobulin levels; there were no serious adverse events. The mean terminal half-life of PRO051 in the circulation was 29 days. PRO051 induced detectable, specific exon-51 skipping at doses of 2.0 mg or more per kilogram. New dystrophin expression was observed between approximately 60{\%} and 100{\%} of muscle fibers in 10 of the 12 patients, as measured on post-treatment biopsy, which increased in a dose-dependent manner to up to 15.6{\%} of the expression in healthy muscle. After the 12-week extension phase, there was a mean (±SD) improvement of 35.2±28.7 m (from the baseline of 384±121 m) on the 6-minute walk test. CONCLUSIONS: Systemically administered PRO051 showed dose-dependent molecular efficacy in patients with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, with a modest improvement in the 6-minute walk test after 12 weeks of extended treatment.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Many different methods exist to adjust for variability in cell-type mixture proportions when analyzing DNA methylation studies. Here we present the result of an extensive simulation study, built on cell-separated DNA methylation profiles from Illumina Infinium 450K methylation data, to compare the performance of eight methods including the most commonly used approaches. RESULTS We designed a rich multi-layered simulation containing a set of probes with true associations with either binary or continuous phenotypes, confounding by cell type, variability in means and standard deviations for population parameters, additional variability at the level of an individual cell-type-specific sample, and variability in the mixture proportions across samples. Performance varied quite substantially across methods and simulations. In particular, the number of false positives was sometimes unrealistically high, indicating limited ability to discriminate the true signals from those appearing significant through confounding. Methods that filtered probes had consequently poor power. QQ plots of p values across all tested probes showed that adjustments did not always improve the distribution. The same methods were used to examine associations between smoking and methylation data from a case-control study of colorectal cancer, and we also explored the effect of cell-type adjustments on associations between rheumatoid arthritis cases and controls. CONCLUSIONS We recommend surrogate variable analysis for cell-type mixture adjustment since performance was stable under all our simulated scenarios.},

abstract = {Sclerostin, encoded by the SOST gene, is a potent inhibitor of bone formation, produced by osteocytes, not by osteoblasts, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms controlling its expression. We aimed to test the hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms, specifically DNA methylation, modulate SOST expression. We found two CpG-rich regions in SOST: region 1, located in the proximal promoter, and region 2, around exon 1. qMSP and pyrosequencing analysis of DNA methylation showed that region 2 was largely methylated in all samples analyzed. In contrast, marked differences were observed in region 1. Whereas the CpG-rich region 1 was hypermethylated in osteoblasts, this region was largely hypomethylated in microdissected human osteocytes. Bone lining cells showed a methylation profile between primary osteoblasts and osteocytes. Whereas SOST expression was detected at very low level or not at all by RT-qPCR in several human osteoblastic and nonosteoblastic cell lines, and human primary osteoblasts under basal conditions, it was dramatically upregulated (up to 1300-fold) by the demethylating agent AzadC. Experiments using reporter vectors demonstrated the functional importance of the region -581/+30 of the SOST gene, which contains the CpG-rich region 1. In vitro methylation of this CpG-island impaired nuclear protein binding and led to a 75 ± 12{\%} inhibition of promoter activity. In addition, BMP-2-induced expression of SOST was markedly enhanced in cells demethylated by AzadC. Overall, these results strongly suggest that DNA methylation is involved in the regulation of SOST expression during osteoblast-osteocyte transition, presumably by preventing the binding of transcription factors to the proximal promoter. To our knowledge, our data provide first ever evidence of the involvement of DNA methylation in the regulation of SOST expression and may help to establish convenient experimental models for further studies of human sclerostin.},

Using nematodes with a loss-of-function mutation in the insulin-like signaling pathway, we show that bec-1, the C. elegans ortholog of the yeast and mammalian autophagy gene APG6/VPS30/beclin1, is essential for normal dauer morphogenesis and life-span extension. Dauer formation is associated with increased autophagy and also requires C. elegans orthologs of the yeast autophagy genes APG1, APG7, APG8, and AUT10. Thus, autophagy is a cellular pathway essential for dauer development and life-span extension in C. elegans.},

These interactions compensate for deviations from the consensus sequence, allowing CTCF to adapt to sequence variations. CTCF is sensitive to cytosine methylation at position 2, but insensitive at position 12 of the 15-bp core sequence. These differences can be rationalized structurally. Although included in crystallizations, ZF10 and ZF11 are not visible, while ZF8 and ZF9 span the backbone of the DNA duplex, conferring no sequence specificity but adding to overall binding stability.},

abstract = {The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has used the latest sequencing and analysis methods to identify somatic variants across thousands of tumours. Here we present data and analytical results for point mutations and small insertions/deletions from 3,281 tumours across 12 tumour types as part of the TCGA Pan-Cancer effort. We illustrate the distributions of mutation frequencies, types and contexts across tumour types, and establish their links to tissues of origin, environmental/carcinogen influences, and DNA repair defects. Using the integrated data sets, we identified 127 significantly mutated genes from well-known (for example, mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol- 3-OH kinase, Wnt/$\beta$-catenin and receptor tyrosine kinase signalling pathways, and cell cycle control) and emerging (for example, histone, histone modification, splicing, metabolism and proteolysis) cellular processes in cancer. The average number of mutations in these significantly mutated genes varies across tumour types; most tumours have two to six, indicating that the number of driver mutations required during oncogenesis is relatively small. Mutations in transcriptional factors/regulators show tissue specificity, whereas histone modifiers are often mutated across several cancer types. Clinical association analysis identifies genes having a significant effect on survival, and investigations of mutations with respect to clonal/subclonal architecture delineate their temporal orders during tumorigenesis. Taken together, these results lay the groundwork for developing new diagnostics and individualizing cancer treatment. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

Previously thought to be restricted to a few housekeeping genes easily detectable in genome sequences, the set of known Pol III-transcribed genes (class III genes) has been expanding in the last ten years, and the issue of their detection, annotation and actual expression has been stimulated and revived by the results of recent high-resolution genome-wide location analyses of the mammalian Pol III machinery, together with those of Pol III-centered computational studies and of ncRNA-focused transcriptomic approaches. In this article, we provide an outline of distinctive features of Pol III-transcribed genes that have allowed and currently allow for their detection in genome sequences, we critically review the currently practiced strategies for the identification of novel class III genes and transcripts, and we discuss emerging themes in Pol III transcription regulation which might orient future transcriptomic studies.

abstract = {Over the last years, the discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) has revolutionized the classic concepts of gene expression regulation and has introduced a new group of molecules that may contribute to the complex changes observed during aging. Although several Caenorhabditis elegans miRNAs have been proved to influence the nematode life span, the current knowledge about miRNA-mediated regulation of mammalian aging is still limited. Recently, we have analyzed the functional relevance of miRNAs in accelerate aging by using Zmpste24-/- mice, a murine model that phenocopies Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. These studies have revealed that the nuclear abnormalities present in these mice affect the expression levels of several miRNAs, including a marked upregulation of miR-1 and miR-29. Furthermore, we have found that the altered expression of these miRNAs may contribute to the progeroid phenotype of mutant mice by modulating the levels of key components of the somatroph axis and DNA damage response pathways. Here, we discuss these recent discoveries and summarize the present evidences regarding the involvement of aging-associated miRNAs or geromiRs in senescence and longevity regulation.},

abstract = {Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are critical adaptor molecules that carry amino acids to a messenger RNA (mRNA) template during protein synthesis. Although tRNAs have commonly been viewed as abundant 'house-keeping' RNAs, it is becoming increasingly clear that tRNA expression is tightly regulated. Depending on a cell's proliferative status, the pool of active tRNAs is rapidly changed, enabling distinct translational programs to be expressed in differentiated versus proliferating cells. Here, I highlight several post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that allow the expression or functions of tRNAs to be altered. Modulating the modification status or structural stability of individual tRNAs can cause those specific tRNA transcripts to selectively accumulate or be degraded. Decay generally occurs via the rapid tRNA decay pathway or by the nuclear RNA surveillance machinery. In addition, the CCA-adding enzyme plays a critical role in determining the fate of a tRNA. The post-transcriptional addition of CCA to the 3' ends of stable tRNAs generates the amino acid attachment site, whereas addition of CCACCA to unstable tRNAs prevents aminoacylation and marks the tRNA for degradation. In response to various stresses, tRNAs can accumulate in the nucleus or be further cleaved into small RNAs, some of which inhibit translation. By implementing these various post-transcriptional control mechanisms, cells are able to fine-tune tRNA levels to regulate subsets of mRNAs as well as overall translation rates.},

These studies are usually performed in umbilical cord blood. Since blood comprises multiple cell types with specific DNA methylation patterns, confounding caused by cellular heterogeneity is a major concern. This can be adjusted for using reference data consisting of DNA methylation signatures in cell types isolated from blood. However, the most commonly used reference data set is based on blood samples from adult males and is not representative of the cell type composition in neonatal cord blood. The aim of this study was to generate a reference data set from cord blood to enable correct adjustment of the cell type composition in samples collected at birth. The purity of the isolated cell types was very high for all samples ({\textgreater}97.1{\%}), and clustering analyses showed distinct grouping of the cell types according to hematopoietic lineage.

Excitingly, new studies show that age-related epigenetic changes can be reversed with interventions such as cyclic expression of the Yamanaka reprogramming factors.

abstract = {Polycomb-mediated repression of gene expression is essential for development, with a pivotal role played by trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), which is deposited by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). The mechanism by which PRC2 is recruited to target genes has remained largely elusive, particularly in vertebrates. Here we demonstrate that MTF2, one of the three vertebrate homologs of Drosophila melanogaster Polycomblike, is a DNA-binding, methylation-sensitive PRC2 recruiter in mouse embryonic stem cells. MTF2 directly binds to DNA and is essential for recruitment of PRC2 both in vitro and in vivo. Genome-wide recruitment of the PRC2 catalytic subunit EZH2 is abrogated in Mtf2 knockout cells, resulting in greatly reduced H3K27me3 deposition. MTF2 selectively binds regions with a high density of unmethylated CpGs in a context of reduced helix twist, which distinguishes target from non-target CpG islands. These results demonstrate instructive recruitment of PRC2 to genomic targets by MTF2.},

At the cell and molecular level, defects to this quality control complex are defined by impairment to mitochondrial form and function. Here, we establish the etiology of these phenotypes. We show how disruptions to the quality control of mitochondrial protein synthesis trigger a sequential stress response characterized first by OMA1 activation followed by loss of mitochondrial ribosomes and by remodelling of mitochondrial inner membrane ultrastructure. Inhibiting mitochondrial protein synthesis with chloramphenicol completely blocks this stress response. Together, our data establish a mechanism linking major cell biological phenotypes of AFG3L2 pathogenesis and show how modulation of mitochondrial protein synthesis can exert a beneficial effect on organelle homeostasis.},

abstract = {Whereas low BMD is known to be a risk factor for fracture, it is not clear whether loss of BMD is also a risk factor. In elderly women, greater loss of BMD at the femoral neck was associated with increased risk of fracture, independent of baseline BMD and age. Introduction: Baseline measurement of BMD predicts fracture risk. However, it is not clear whether short-term bone loss is an independent risk factor for fractures. This study was designed to investigate the relationship between changes in BMD and fracture risk in elderly women in the general population. Materials and Methods: A total of 966 women ≥60 years of age (mean, 70 ± 6.7 [SD] years), who had been followed for an average of 10.7 years, were studied. Atraumatic fracture of the proximal femur (hip), symptomatic vertebral fracture, and other major fractures, excluding pathological fractures or those resulting from severe trauma, were recorded and confirmed by radiographs. Femoral neck and lumbar spine BMD was measured by DXA. Results: During the follow-up period, 224 had sustained a fracture (including 43 hip, 71 symptomatic vertebrae, 37 proximal humerus, 46 forearm and wrist, and 27 rib and pelvis fractures). The annual rate of change in BMD in fracture women (-2.1 ± 4.2{\%}) was significantly higher than that in nonfracture women (-0.8 ± 2.8{\%}; p = 0.005). In the multivariable Cox's proportional hazards analysis, the following factors were significant predictors of fracture risk: femoral neck bone loss (relative hazard [RH], 1.4; 95{\%} CI, 1.1-1.8 per 5{\%} loss), baseline femoral neck BMD (RH, 2.0; 95{\%} CI, 1.7-2.7 per SD), and advancing age (RH, 1.2; 95{\%} CI, 1.1-1.4). The proportion of fractures attributable to the three factors was 45{\%}. For hip fracture, the attributable risk fraction was ∼90{\%}. Conclusion: Bone loss at the femoral neck is a predictor of fracture risk in elderly women, independent of baseline BMD and age. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.},

abstract = {SIN3 was first identified genetically as a global regulator of transcription. Sin3 is a large protein composed mainly of protein-interaction domains, whose function is to provide structural support for a heterogeneous Sin3/histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex. The core Sin3/HDAC complex is conserved from yeast to man and consists of eight proteins. In addition to HDACs, Sin3 can sequester other enzymatic functions, including nucleosome remodeling, DNA methylation, N-acetylglucoseamine transferase activity, and histone methylation. Since the Sin3/HDAC complex lacks any DNA-binding activity, it must be targeted to gene promoters by interacting with DNA-binding proteins. Although most research on Sin3 has focused on its role as a corepressor, mounting evidence suggests that Sin3 can also positively regulate transcription. Furthermore, Sin3 is key to the propagation of epigenetically silenced domains and is required for centromere function. Thus, Sin3 provides a platform to deliver multiple combinations modifications to the chromatin, using both sequence-specific and sequence-independent mechanisms.},

Here, we report a class of circRNAs associated with RNA polymerase II in human cells. In these circRNAs, exons are circularized with introns 'retained' between exons; we term them exon-intron circRNAs or EIciRNAs. EIciRNAs predominantly localize in the nucleus, interact with U1 snRNP and promote transcription of their parental genes. Our findings reveal a new role for circRNAs in regulating gene expression in the nucleus, in which EIciRNAs enhance the expression of their parental genes in cis, and highlight a regulatory strategy for transcriptional control via specific RNA-RNA interaction between U1 snRNA and EIciRNAs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Nuclear localization signals (NLSs) are stretches of residues within a protein that are important for the regulated nuclear import of the protein. Of the many import pathways that exist in yeast, the best characterized is termed the 'classical' NLS pathway. The classical NLS contains specific patterns of basic residues and computational methods have been designed to predict the location of these motifs on proteins. The consensus sequences, or patterns, for the other import pathways are less well-understood. RESULTS In this paper, we present an analysis of characterized NLSs in yeast, and find, despite the large number of nuclear import pathways, that NLSs seem to show similar patterns of amino acid residues. We test current prediction methods and observe a low true positive rate. We therefore suggest an approach using hidden Markov models (HMMs) to predict novel NLSs in proteins. We show that our method is able to consistently find 37{\%} of the NLSs with a low false positive rate and that our method retains its true positive rate outside of the yeast data set used for the training parameters. CONCLUSION Our implementation of this model, NLStradamus, is made available at: (http://www.moseslab.csb.utoronto.ca/NLStradamus/).},

This demethylation activity of ALKBH5 significantly affects mRNA export and RNA metabolism as well as the assembly of mRNA processing factors in nuclear speckles. Alkbh5-deficient male mice have increased m(6)A in mRNA and are characterized by impaired fertility resulting from apoptosis that affects meiotic metaphase-stage spermatocytes. In accordance with this defect, we have identified in mouse testes 1,551 differentially expressed genes that cover broad functional categories and include spermatogenesis-related mRNAs involved in the p53 functional interaction network. The discovery of this RNA demethylase strongly suggests that the reversible m(6)A modification has fundamental and broad functions in mammalian cells.},

abstract = {We present a statistical model for patterns of genetic variation in samples of unrelated individuals from natural populations. This model is based on the idea that, over short regions, haplotypes in a population tend to cluster into groups of similar haplotypes. To capture the fact that, because of recombination, this clustering tends to be local in nature, our model allows cluster memberships to change continuously along the chromosome according to a hidden Markov model. This approach is flexible, allowing for both "block-like" patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and gradual decline in LD with distance. The resulting model is also fast and, as a result, is practicable for large data sets (e.g., thousands of individuals typed at hundreds of thousands of markers). We illustrate the utility of the model by applying it to dense single-nucleotide-polymorphism genotype data for the tasks of imputing missing genotypes and estimating haplotypic phase. For imputing missing genotypes, methods based on this model are as accurate or more accurate than existing methods. For haplotype estimation, the point estimates are slightly less accurate than those from the best existing methods (e.g., for unrelated Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain individuals from the HapMap project, switch error was 0.055 for our method vs. 0.051 for PHASE) but require a small fraction of the computational cost. In addition, we demonstrate that the model accurately reflects uncertainty in its estimates, in that probabilities computed using the model are approximately well calibrated. The methods described in this article are implemented in a software package, fastPHASE, which is available from the Stephens Lab Web site.},

abstract = {Both an increase in osteoclast and a decrease in osteoblast numbers contribute to skeletal aging. Markers of cellular senescence, including expression of the cyclin inhibitor p16, increase with aging in several bone cell populations. The elimination of p16-expressing cells in old mice, using the INK-ATTAC transgene, increases bone mass indicating that senescent cells contribute to skeletal aging. However, the identity of the senescent cells and the extent to which ablation of p16-expressing cells may prevent skeletal aging remain unknown. Using mice expressing the p16-3MR transgene, we examined whether elimination of p16-expressing cells between 12 and 24 months of age could preserve bone mass; and whether elimination of these cells from 20 to 26 months of age could restore bone mass. The activation of the p16-3MR transgene by ganciclovir (GCV) greatly diminished p16 levels in the brain, liver, and osteoclast progenitors from the bone marrow. The age-related increase in osteoclastogenic potential of myeloid cells was also abrogated by GCV. However, GCV did not alter p16 levels in osteocytes—the most abundant cell type in bone—and had no effect on the skeletal aging of p16-3MR mice. These findings indicate that the p16-3MR transgene does not eliminate senescent osteocytes but it does eliminate senescent osteoclast progenitors and senescent cells in other tissues, as described previously. Elimination of senescent osteoclast progenitors, in and of itself, has no effect on the age-related loss of bone mass. Hence, other senescent cell types, such as osteocytes, must be the seminal culprits.},

abstract = {Dietary restriction extends healthy lifespan in diverse organisms and reduces fecundity. It is widely assumed to induce adaptive reallocation of nutrients from reproduction to somatic maintenance, aiding survival of food shortages in nature. If this were the case, long life under dietary restriction and high fecundity under full feeding would be mutually exclusive, through competition for the same limiting nutrients. Here we report a test of this idea in which we identified the nutrients producing the responses of lifespan and fecundity to dietary restriction in Drosophila. Adding essential amino acids to the dietary restriction condition increased fecundity and decreased lifespan, similar to the effects of full feeding, with other nutrients having little or no effect. However, methionine alone was necessary and sufficient to increase fecundity as much as did full feeding, but without reducing lifespan. Reallocation of nutrients therefore does not explain the responses to dietary restriction. Lifespan was decreased by the addition of amino acids, with an interaction between methionine and other essential amino acids having a key role. Hence, an imbalance in dietary amino acids away from the ratio optimal for reproduction shortens lifespan during full feeding and limits fecundity during dietary restriction. Reduced activity of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling pathway extends lifespan in diverse organisms, and we find that it also protects against the shortening of lifespan with full feeding. In other organisms, including mammals, it may be possible to obtain the benefits to lifespan of dietary restriction without incurring a reduction in fecundity, through a suitable balance of nutrients in the diet.},

abstract = {Of all the proposed causes of ageing, DNA damage remains a leading, though still debated theory. Unlike most other types of age-related cellular damage, which can hypothetically be reversed, mutations in DNA are permanent. Such errors result in the accumulation of changes to RNA and protein sequences with age, and are tightly linked to cellular senescence and overall organ dysfunction. Over the past few years, an additional, more global role has emerged for the contribution of DNA damage and genomic instability to the ageing process. We, and others have found that DNA damage and the concomitant repair process can induce genome-wide epigenetic changes, which may promote a variety of age-related transcriptional and functional changes. Here, we discuss the link between DNA damage, chromatin alterations and ageing, an interplay that explains how seemingly random DNA damage could manifest in predictable phenotypic changes that define ageing, changes that may ultimately be reversible. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {As a step in the characterization of development and ageing in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the activities of different groups of enzymes that supposedly exert modulating functions in and after protein synthesis have been determined. From embryonic (E), the four juvenile larval stages (L1-L4) and the gravid adult (A,A+), the selection of defined developmental stages extends to two different preparations of aged nematodes (S10, S12). Some aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activities remain nearly unchanged in all stages up to the adult, some increase continuously during the larval stages and the remaining activities show stage-specific alterations. Upon ageing all activities except the one for tryptophan decrease sharply, tRNA methylase activities increase from E to L4, decrease from L4 to adult and to aged nematodes with only qualitative alterations in substrate specificity. The activity of tubulin: tyrosine ligase exhibits a parallel pattern, while arginyltransferase activity has a plateau between L2 and L4. The results are consistent with the idea of a modulation of protein synthesis and other cellular processes by quantitative activity changes during development and ageing.},

Annotation of circRNAs depends on sequencing reads spanning the backsplice junction and therefore map as non-linear reads in the genome. Several pipelines have been developed to specifically identify these non-linear reads and consequently predict the landscape of circRNAs based on deep sequencing datasets. Here, we use common RNAseq datasets to scrutinize and compare the output from five different algorithms; circRNA{\_}finder, find{\_}circ, CIRCexplorer, CIRI, and MapSplice and evaluate the levels of bona fide and false positive circRNAs based on RNase R resistance. By this approach, we observe surprisingly dramatic differences between the algorithms specifically regarding the highly expressed circRNAs and the circRNAs derived from proximal splice sites. Collectively, this study emphasizes that circRNA annotation should be handled with care and that several algorithms should ideally be combined to achieve reliable predictions.},

Here we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to separate catalytic activity-dependent and independent functions of Mll3 (Kmt2c) and Mll4 (Kmt2d, Mll2), the major enhancer H3K4 monomethyltransferases. Loss of H3K4me1 from enhancers in Mll3/4 catalytically deficient cells causes partial reduction of H3K27ac, but has surprisingly minor effects on transcription from either enhancers or promoters. In contrast, loss of Mll3/4 proteins leads to strong depletion of enhancer Pol II occupancy and eRNA synthesis, concomitant with downregulation of target genes. Interestingly, downregulated genes exhibit reduced polymerase levels in gene bodies, but not at promoters, suggestive of pause-release defects. Altogether, our results suggest that enhancer H3K4me1 provides only a minor contribution to the long-range coactivator function of Mll3/4.},

abstract = {Recent genomic approaches have revealed that the repertoire of RNA Pol III-transcribed genes varies in different human cell types, and that this variation is likely determined by a combination of the chromatin landscape, cell-specific DNA-binding transcription factors, and collaboration with RNA Pol II. Although much is known about this regulation in differentiated human cells, there is presently little understanding of this aspect of the Pol III system in human ES cells. Here, we determine the occupancy profiles of Pol III components in human H1 ES cells, and also induced pluripotent cells, and compare to known profiles of chromatin, transcription factors, and RNA expression. We find a relatively large fraction of the Pol III repertoire occupied in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). In ES cells we find clear correlations between Pol III occupancy and active chromatin. Interestingly, we find a highly significant fraction of Pol III-occupied genes with adjacent binding events by pluripotency factors in ES cells, especially NANOG. Notably, in human ES cells we find H3K27me3 adjacent to but not overlapping many active Pol III loci. We observe in all such cases, a peak of H3K4me3 and/or RNA Pol II, between the H3K27me3 and Pol III binding peaks, suggesting that H3K4me3 and Pol II activity may “insulate” Pol III from neighboring repressive H3K27me3. Further, we find iPSCs have a larger Pol III repertoire than their precursors. Finally, the active Pol III genome in iPSCs is not completely reprogrammed to a hESC like state and partially retains the transcriptional repertoire of the precursor. Together, our correlative results are consistent with Pol III binding and activity in human ES cells being enabled by active/permissive chromatin that is shaped in part by the pluripotency network of transcription factors and RNA Pol II activity.},

abstract = {Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation play a key role in gene regulation and disease susceptibility. However, little is known about the genome-wide frequency, localization, and function of methylation variation and how it is regulated by genetic and environmental factors.We utilized the Multiple Tissue Human Expression Resource (MuTHER) and generated Illumina 450K adipose methylome data from 648 twins.We found that individual CpGs had low variance and that variability was suppressed in promoters.We noted that DNA methylation variation was highly heritable (2median = 0.34) and that shared environmental effects correlated with metabolic phenotype-associated CpGs. Analysis of methylation quantitative-trait loci (metQTL) revealed that 28{\%} of CpGs were associated with nearby SNPs, and when overlapping them with adipose expression quantitative-trait loci (eQTL) from the same individuals, we found that 6{\%} of the loci played a role in regulating both gene expression and DNA methylation. These associations were bidirectional, but there were pronounced negative associations for promoter CpGs. Integration of metQTL with adipose reference epigenomes and disease associations revealed significant enrichment of metQTL overlapping metabolic-trait or disease loci in enhancers (the strongesteffects were for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and body mass index [BMI]). We followed up with the BMI SNP rs713586, a cg01884057 metQTL that overlaps an enhancer upstream of ADCY3, and used bisulphite sequencing to refine this region. Our results showed widespread population invariability yet sequence dependence on adipose DNA methylation but that incorporating maps of regulatory elements aid in linking CpG variation to gene regulation and disease risk in a tissue-dependent manner. {\textcopyright} 2013 by The American Society of Human Genetics.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individual genotypes at specific loci can result in different patterns of DNA methylation. These methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs) influence methylation across extended genomic regions and may underlie direct SNP associations or gene-environment interactions. We hypothesized that the detection of meQTLs varies with ancestral population, developmental stage, and tissue type. We explored this by analyzing seven datasets that varied by ancestry (African American vs. Caucasian), developmental stage (neonate vs. adult), and tissue type (blood vs. four regions of postmortem brain) with genome-wide DNA methylation and SNP data. We tested for meQTLs by constructing linear regression models of methylation levels at each CpG site on SNP genotypes within 50 kb under an additive model controlling for multiple tests.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Most meQTLs mapped to intronic regions, although a limited number appeared to occur in synonymous or nonsynonymous coding SNPs. We saw significant overlap of meQTLs between ancestral groups, developmental stages, and tissue types, with the highest rates of overlap within the four brain regions. Compared with a random group of SNPs with comparable frequencies, meQTLs were more likely to be 1) represented among the most associated SNPs in the WTCCC bipolar disorder results and 2) located in microRNA binding sites.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These data give us insight into how SNPs impact gene regulation and support the notion that peripheral blood may be a reliable correlate of physiological processes in other tissues.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION Bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) has emerged as the gold standard to study genome-wide DNA methylation at single-nucleotide resolution. Quality control (QC) is a critical step in the analysis pipeline to ensure that BS-seq data are of high quality and suitable for subsequent analysis. Although several QC tools are available for next-generation sequencing data, most of them were not designed to handle QC issues specific to BS-seq protocols. Therefore, there is a strong need for a dedicated QC tool to evaluate and remove potential technical biases in BS-seq experiments. RESULTS We developed a package named BSeQC to comprehensively evaluate the quality of BS-seq experiments and automatically trim nucleotides with potential technical biases that may result in inaccurate methylation estimation. BSeQC takes standard SAM/BAM files as input and generates bias-free SAM/BAM files for downstream analysis.

abstract = {In humans, DNA methylation at specific CpG sites can be used to estimate the ‘epigenetic clock', a biomarker of aging and health. The mechanisms that regulate the aging epigenome and level of conservation are not entirely clear. We performed affinity-based enrichment with methyl-CpG binding domain protein followed by high-throughput sequencing (MBD-seq) to assay DNA methylation in mouse samples. Consistent with previous reports, aging is associated with increase in methylation at CpG islands that likely overlap regulatory regions of genes that have been implicated in cancers (e.g., C1ql3, Srd5a2 and Ptk7). The differentially methylated regions in mice have high sequence conservation in humans and the pattern of methylation is also largely conserved between the two species. Based on human ENCODE data, these sites are targeted by polycomb proteins, including EZH2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed that these regions interact with EZH2 in mice as well, and there may be reduction in EZH2 occupancy with age at C1ql3. This adds to the growing evidence that EZH2 is part of the protein machinery that shapes the aging epigenome. The conservation in both sequence and methylation patterns of the age-dependent CpGs indicate that the epigenetic clock is a fundamental feature of aging in mammals.},

abstract = {Aberrant methylation patterns have long been known to exist in the promoter regions of key regulatory genes in the DNA of tumor cells. However, the mechanisms by which these methylation patterns become altered during the transformation of normal cells to tumor cells have remained elusive. We have recently shown in in vitro studies that inflammation-mediated halogenated cytosine damage products can mimic 5-methylcytosine in directing enzymatic DNA methylation and in enhancing the binding of methyl-binding proteins whereas certain oxidative damage products inhibit both. We have therefore proposed that cytosine damage products could potentially interfere with normal epigenetic control by altering DNA-protein interactions critical for gene regulation and the heritable transmission of methylation patterns. These inflammation-mediated cytosine damage products may provide, in some cases, a mechanistic link between inflammation and cancer. {\textcopyright}2007 American Association for Cancer Research.},

abstract = {Short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), such as Alu, spread by retrotransposition, which requires their transcripts to be copied into DNA and then inserted into new chromosomal sites. This can lead to genetic damage through insertional mutagenesis and chromosomal rearrangements between non-allelic SINEs at distinct loci. SINE DNA is heavily methylated and this was thought to suppress its accessibility and transcription, thereby protecting against retrotransposition. Here we provide several lines of evidence that methylated SINE DNA is occupied by RNA polymerase III, including the use of high-throughput bisulphite sequencing of ChIP DNA. We find that loss of DNA methylation has little effect on accessibility of SINEs to transcription machinery or their expression in vivo. In contrast, a histone methyltransferase inhibitor selectively promotes SINE expression and occupancy by RNA polymerase III. The data suggest that methylation of histones rather than DNA plays a dominant role in suppressing SINE transcription.},

A series of papers reporting age-related changes in DNA methylation profiles in peripheral blood have already been published. However, blood is a heterogeneous collection of different cell types, each with a very different DNA methylation profile. RESULTS Using a statistical method that permits estimating the relative proportion of cell types from DNA methylation profiles, we examine data from five previously published studies, and find strong evidence of cell composition change across age in blood. We also demonstrate that, in these studies, cellular composition explains much of the observed variability in DNA methylation. Furthermore, we find high levels of confounding between age-related variability and cellular composition at the CpG level. CONCLUSIONS Our findings underscore the importance of considering cell composition variability in epigenetic studies based on whole blood and other heterogeneous tissue sources. We also provide software for estimating and exploring this composition confounding for the Illumina 450k microarray.},

abstract = {DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is an important component of the epigenetic machinery and is responsible for copying DNA methylation patterns during cell division. Coordination of DNA methylation and DNA replication is critical for maintaining epigenetic programming. Knockdown of DNMT1 leads to inhibition of DNA replication, but the mechanism has been unclear. Here we show that depletion of DNMT1 with either antisense or small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific to DNMT1 activates a cascade of genotoxic stress checkpoint proteins, resulting in phosphorylation of checkpoint kinases 1 and 2 (Chk1 and -2), gammaH2AX focus formation, and cell division control protein 25a (CDC25a) degradation, in an ataxia telangiectasia mutated-Rad3-related (ATR)-dependent manner. siRNA knockdown of ATR blocks the response to DNMT1 depletion; DNA synthesis continues in the absence of DNMT1, resulting in global hypomethylation. Similarly, the response to DNMT1 knockdown is significantly attenuated in human mutant ATR fibroblast cells from a Seckel syndrome patient. This response is sensitive to DNMT1 depletion, independent of the catalytic domain of DNMT1, as indicated by abolition of the response with ectopic expression of either DNMT1 or DNMT1 with the catalytic domain deleted. There is no response to short-term treatment with 5-aza-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR), which causes demethylation by trapping DNMT1 in 5-aza-CdR-containing DNA but does not cause disappearance of DNMT1 from the nucleus. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that removal of DNMT1 from replication forks is the trigger for this response.},

Since MIR elements ceased to amplify ∼130 myr ago, previous studies primarily focused on their genomic impact, while the issue of their expression has not been extensively addressed. We applied a dedicated bioinformatic pipeline to ENCODE RNA-Seq datasets of seven human cell lines and, for the first time, we were able to define the Pol III-driven MIR transcriptome at single-locus resolution. While the majority of Pol III-transcribed MIR elements are cell-specific, we discovered a small set of ubiquitously transcribed MIRs mapping within Pol II-transcribed genes in antisense orientation that could influence the expression of the overlapping gene. We also identified novel Pol III-transcribed ncRNAs, deriving from transcription of annotated MIR fragments flanked by unique MIR-unrelated sequences, and confirmed the role of Pol III-specific internal promoter elements in MIR transcription. Besides demonstrating widespread transcription at these retrotranspositionally inactive elements in human cells, the ability to profile MIR expression at single-locus resolution will facilitate their study in different cell types and states including pathological alterations.},

SLiCE overcomes the sequence limitations of traditional cloning methods, facilitates seamless cloning by recombining short end homologies (≥15 bp) with or without flanking heterologous sequences and provides an effective strategy for directional subcloning of DNA fragments from Bacteria Artificial Chromosomes (BACs) or other sources. SLiCE is highly cost effective as a number of standard laboratory bacterial strains can serve as sources for SLiCE extract. In addition, the cloning efficiencies and capabilities of these strains can be greatly improved by simple genetic modifications. As an example, we modified the DH10B Escherichia coli strain to express an optimized $\lambda$ prophage Red recombination system. This strain, termed PPY, facilitates SLiCE with very high efficiencies and demonstrates the versatility of the method.},

Anti-sense oligonucleotides can induce specific exon removal during processing of the dystrophin primary transcript, while maintaining or restoring the reading frame, and thereby overcome protein-truncating mutations. The mdx mouse has a non-sense mutation in exon 23 of the dystrophin gene that precludes functional dystrophin production, and this model has been used in the development of treatment strategies for dystrophinopathies. A phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) has previously been shown to exclude exon 23 from the dystrophin gene transcript and induce dystrophin expression in the mdxmouse, in vivo and in vitro. In this report, a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP)-conjugated oligomer targeted to the mouse dystrophin exon 23 donor splice site was administered to mdxmice by intraperitoneal injection. We demonstrate dystrophin expression and near-normal muscle architecture in all muscles examined, except for cardiac muscle. The CPP greatly enhanced uptake of the PMO, resulting in widespread dystrophin expression.},

abstract = {A mechanism of aging is proposed for mammals and other vertebrates. In this mechanism, most somatic cells have inherent deficiencies in methylation metabolism with respect to their capacity to methylate DNA. This leads to incomplete DNA methylation in each cell cycle which, accumulated over many cell cycles, contributes to genetic instability, senescence and cancer. These proposed metabolic deficiencies are present from the time somatic cells are young, yet it is only after many cell divisions that deleterious effects are realized. In nature, most animals have reproduced or have been killed by predators or other environmental hazards before they can be greatly affected by these deficiencies. These deficiencies evolved in animals eating a balance of nutrients from nature. Evidence from the literature is reviewed which establishes that methylation is lost from the DNA of many mammalian somatic cells as they age both in vivo and in vitro, and that DNA methylation levels are influenced by factors, such as diet, that affect methylation metabolism. Partially correcting the proposed deficiencies is considered as a possible molecular mechanism by which caloric restriction extends lifespan. Other possible dietary and transgenic means to correct the proposed deficiencies and extend lifespan are discussed.},

abstract = {The helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain is a common denominator in basal and specific transcription factors from the three super-kingdoms of life. At its core, the domain comprises of an open tri-helical bundle, which typically binds DNA with the 3rd helix. Drawing on the wealth of data that has accumulated over two decades since the discovery of the domain, we present an overview of the natural history of the HTH domain from the viewpoint of structural analysis and comparative genomics. In structural terms, the HTH domains have developed several elaborations on the basic 3-helical core, such as the tetra-helical bundle, the winged-helix and the ribbon-helix-helix type configurations. In functional terms, the HTH domains are present in the most prevalent transcription factors of all prokaryotic genomes and some eukaryotic genomes. They have been recruited to a wide range of functions beyond transcription regulation, which include DNA repair and replication, RNA metabolism and protein-protein interactions in diverse signaling contexts. Beyond their basic role in mediating macromolecular interactions, the HTH domains have also been incorporated into the catalytic domains of diverse enzymes. We discuss the general domain architectural themes that have arisen amongst the HTH domains as a result of their recruitment to these diverse functions. We present a natural classification, higher-order relationships and phyletic pattern analysis of all the major families of HTH domains. This reconstruction suggests that there were at least 6-11 different HTH domains in the last universal common ancestor of all life forms, which covered much of the structural diversity and part of the functional versatility of the extant representatives of this domain. In prokaryotes the total number of HTH domains per genome shows a strong power-equation type scaling with the gene number per genome. However, the HTH domains in two-component signaling pathways show a linear scaling with gene number, in contrast to the non-linear scaling of HTH domains in single-component systems and sigma factors. These observations point to distinct evolutionary forces in the emergence of different signaling systems with HTH transcription factors. The archaea and bacteria share a number of ancient families of specific HTH transcription factors. However, they do not share any orthologous HTH proteins in the basal transcription apparatus. This differential relationship of their basal and specific transcriptional machinery poses an apparent conundrum regarding the origins of their transcription apparatus.},

abstract = {We have cloned a series of overlapping cDNA clones encoding a 5194 bp transcript for human DNA methyltransferase (DNA MTase). This sequence potentially codes for a protein of 1495 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 169 kDa. The human DNA MTase cDNA has eighty percent homology at the nucleotide level, and the predicted protein has seventy-four percent identity at the amino acid level, to the DNA MTase cDNA cloned from mouse cells. Like the murine DNA MTase, the amino terminal two-thirds of the human protein contains a cysteine-rich region suggestive of a metal-binding domain. The carboxy terminal one-third of the protein shows considerable similarity to prokaryotic (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases. The arrangement of multiple motifs conserved in the prokaryotic genes is preserved in the human DNA MTase, including the relative position of a proline-cysteine dipeptide thought to be an essential catalytic site in all (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases. A single 5.2 kb transcript was detected in all human tissues tested, with the highest levels of expression observed in RNA from placenta, brain, heart and lung. DNA MTase cDNA clones were used to screen a chromosome 19 genomic cosmid library. The DNA MTase-positive cosmids which are estimated to span a genomic distance of 93 kb have been localized to 19p13.2-p13.3 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Isolation of the cDNA for human DNA MTase will allow further study of the regulation of DNA MTase expression, and of the role of this enzyme in establishing DNA methylation patterns in both normal and neoplastic cells.},

abstract = {Phosphate plays many essential roles in our body. To accomplish these functions, serum phosphate needs to be maintained in a certain range. Serum phosphate level is regulated by intestinal phosphate absorption, renal phosphate handling and equilibrium of extracellular phosphate with that in bone or intracellular fluid. Several hormones such as parathyroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) regulate serum phosphate by modulating intestinal phosphate absorption, renal phosphate reabsorption and/or bone metabolism. In addition, dietary phosphate rapidly enhances renal phosphate excretion, although detailed mechanisms of this adaptation remain to be clarified. Physiologically, extracellular concentrations of phosphate and these hormones are maintained by several negative feedback loops. For example, 1,25(OH)2D enhances FGF23 production and FGF23 reduces 1,25(OH)2D level. In addition, phosphate affects 1,25(OH)2D and FGF23 levels. Dysfunction of these negative feedback loops results in several diseases with abnormal phosphate and 1,25(OH)2D levels. Especially, excess actions of FGF23 cause several hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia with relatively low level of 1,25(OH)2D that had been classified as vitamin D-resistant rickets/osteomalacia. In contrast, deficient actions of FGF23 cause hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis. However, there still remain several unanswered questions regarding phosphate and vitamin D metabolism.},

Here, we describe the genome-wide comparative analysis of the 5mC, 5hmC, 5fC, and 5caC profiles of repetitive elements in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and mouse embryonic stem cells. We provide evidence for distinct and highly specific DNA methylation/oxidation patterns of the repetitive elements in both cell types, which mainly affect CA repeats and evolutionarily conserved mouse-specific transposable elements including IAP-LTRs, SINEs B1m/B2m, and L1Md-LINEs. DNA methylation controls the expression of these retroelements, which are clustered at specific locations in the mouse genome. We show that TDG is implicated in the regulation of their unique DNA methylation/oxidation signatures and their dynamics. Our data suggest the existence of a novel epigenetic code for the most recently acquired evolutionarily conserved repeats that could play a major role in cell differentiation.},

The following three major evolutionary theories of aging are discussed: 1) the theory of programmed death suggested by August Weismann, 2) the mutation accumulation theory of aging suggested by Peter Medawar, and 3) the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging suggested by George Williams. We also discuss a special case of the antagonistic pleiotropy theory, the disposable soma theory developed by Tom Kirkwood and Robin Holliday. The theories are compared with each other as well as with recent experimental findings. At present the most viable evolutionary theories are the mutation accumulation theory and the antagonistic pleiotropy theory; these theories are not mutually exclusive, and they both may become a part of a future unifying theory of aging.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND It is not yet known whether DNA methylation levels can be used to accurately predict age across a broad spectrum of human tissues and cell types, nor whether the resulting age prediction is a biologically meaningful measure. RESULTS I developed a multi-tissue predictor of age that allows one to estimate the DNA methylation age of most tissues and cell types. The predictor, which is freely available, was developed using 8,000 samples from 82 Illumina DNA methylation array datasets, encompassing 51 healthy tissues and cell types. I found that DNA methylation age has the following properties: first, it is close to zero for embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells; second, it correlates with cell passage number; third, it gives rise to a highly heritable measure of age acceleration; and, fourth, it is applicable to chimpanzee tissues. Analysis of 6,000 cancer samples from 32 datasets showed that all of the considered 20 cancer types exhibit significant age acceleration, with an average of 36 years. Low age-acceleration of cancer tissue is associated with a high number of somatic mutations and TP53 mutations, while mutations in steroid receptors greatly accelerate DNA methylation age in breast cancer. Finally, I characterize the 353 CpG sites that together form an aging clock in terms of chromatin states and tissue variance. CONCLUSIONS I propose that DNA methylation age measures the cumulative effect of an epigenetic maintenance system. This novel epigenetic clock can be used to address a host of questions in developmental biology, cancer and aging research.},

abstract = {N6-Methyladenosine is a ubiquitous modification identified in the mRNA of numerous eukaryotes, where it is present within both coding and noncoding regions. However, this base modification does not alter the coding capacity, and its biological significance remains unclear. We show that Arabidopsis thaliana mRNA contains N6-methyladenosine at levels similar to those previously reported for animal cells. We further show that inactivation of the Arabidopsis ortholog of the yeast and human mRNA adenosine methylase (MTA) results in failure of the developing embryo to progress past the globular stage. We also demonstrate that the arrested seeds are deficient in mRNAs containing N6-methyladenosine. Expression of MTA is strongly associated with dividing tissues, particularly reproductive organs, shoot meristems, and emerging lateral roots. Finally, we show that MTA interacts in vitro and in vivo with At FIP37, a homolog of the Drosophila protein FEMALE LETHAL2D and of human WILMS' TUMOUR1-ASSOCIATING PROTEIN. The results reported here provide direct evidence for an essential function for N6-methyladenosine in a multicellular eukaryote, and the interaction with At FIP37 suggests possible RNA processing events that might be regulated or altered by this base modification.},

abstract = {With the increase in genomewide experiments and the sequencing of multiple genomes, the analysis of large data sets has become commonplace in biology. It is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.},

abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) have shared an exceptionally long coexistence with their host organisms and have come to occupy a significant fraction of eukaryotic genomes. The bulk of the expansion occurring within mammalian genomes has arisen from the activity of type I retrotransposons, which amplify in a "copy-and-paste" fashion through an RNA intermediate. For better or worse, the sequences of these retrotransposons are now wedded to the genomes of their mammalian hosts. Although there are several reported instances of the positive contribution of mobile elements to their host genomes, these discoveries have occurred alongside growing evidence of the role of TEs in human disease and genetic instability. Here we examine, with a particular emphasis on human retrotransposon activity, several newly discovered aspects of mammalian retrotransposon biology. We consider their potential impact on host biology as well as their ultimate implications for the nature of the TE-host relationship. {\textcopyright}2008 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

abstract = {This unit describes a method for determining the accessibility of chromatinized DNA and nucleosome occupancy in the same assay. Enzymatic digestion of chromatin using micrococcal nuclease (MNase) is optimized for liberation, retrieval, and characterization of DNA fragments from chromatin. MNase digestion is performed in a titration series, and the DNA fragments are isolated and sequenced for each individual digest independently. These sequenced fragments are then collectively analyzed in a novel bioinformatics pipeline to produce a metric describing MNase accessibility of chromatin (MACC) and nucleosome occupancy. This approach allows profiling of the entire genome including regions of open and closed chromatin.Moreover, theMACC protocol can be supplemented with a histone immunoprecipitation step to estimate and compare both histone and non-histone DNA protection components.},

abstract = {In mammals, DNA methylation in the form of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) can be actively reversed to unmodified cytosine (C) through TET dioxygenase-mediated oxidation of 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC), followed by replication-dependent dilution or thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG)-dependent base excision repair. In the past few years, biochemical and structural studies have revealed mechanistic insights into how TET and TDG mediate active DNA demethylation. Additionally, many regulatory mechanisms of this process have been identified. Technological advances in mapping and tracing the oxidized forms of 5mC allow further dissection of their functions. Furthermore, the biological functions of active DNA demethylation in various biological contexts have also been revealed. In this Review, we summarize the recent advances and highlight key unanswered questions.},

Among recent updates are the release of variation calls from 1000 Genomes Project data calculated directly on GRCh38 and the addition of high coverage sequence data for the 2504 samples in the 1000 Genomes Project phase three panel. The data portal, which facilitates web-based exploration of the IGSR resources, has been updated to include samples which were not part of the 1000 Genomes Project and now presents a unified view of data and samples across almost 5000 samples from multiple studies.

abstract = {Background:We investigated relationships between early growth and proximal femoral geometry at age 6 y in a prospective population-based cohort, the Southampton Women's Survey.Methods:In 493 mother-offspring pairs, we assessed linear size using high-resolution ultrasound at 11, 19, and 34 wk gestation (femur length) and at birth and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 y (crown-heel length/height). SD scores were created and conditional regression modeling generated mutually independent growth variables. Children underwent hip dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at 6 y; hip structure analysis software yielded measures of geometry and strength.Results:There were strong associations between early linear growth and femoral neck section modulus (Z) at 6 y, with the strongest relationships observed for femur growth from 19 to 34 wk gestation ($\beta$ = 0.26 cm 3 /SD, P {\textless} 0.0001), and for height growth from birth to 1 y ($\beta$ = 0.25 cm 3 /SD, P {\textless} 0.0001) and 1 to 2 y ($\beta$ = 0.33 cm 3 /SD, P {\textless} 0.0001), with progressively weaker relationships over years 3 ($\beta$ = 0.23 cm 3 /SD, P = 0.0002) and 4 ($\beta$ = 0.10 cm 3 /SD, P = 0.18).Conclusion:These results demonstrate that growth before age 3 y predicts proximal femoral geometry at 6 y old. These data suggest critical periods in which there is capacity for long-term influence on the later skeletal growth trajectory.

abstract = {Many biological indicators related to chronological age have been proposed. Recent studies found that epigenetic clock or DNA methylation age is highly correlated with chronological age. In particular, a significant difference between DNA methylation age (m-age) and chronological age was observed in cancers. However, the prediction and characterization of m-age in pan-cancer remains an explored area. In this study, 1,631 age-related methylation sites in normal tissues were discovered and analyzed. A comprehensive computational model named CancerClock was constructed to predict the m-age for normal samples based on methylation levels of the extracted methylation sites. LASSO linear regression model was used to screen and train the CancerClock model in normal tissues. The accuracy of CancerClock has proved to be 81{\%}, and the correlation value between chronological age and m-age was 0.939 (P {\textless} 0.01). Next, CancerClock was used to evaluate the difference between m-age and chronological age for 33 cancer types from TCGA. There were significant differences between predicted m-age and chronological age in large number of cancer samples. These cancer samples were defined as “age-related cancer samples” and they have some differential methylation sites. The differences between predicted m-age and chronological age may contribute to cancer development. Some of these differential methylation sites were associated with cancer survival. CancerClock provided assistance in estimating the m-age in normal and cancer samples. The changes between m-age and chronological age may improve the diagnosis and prognosis of cancers.},

Many recent studies reinvigorate the idea that these elements are pervasively co-opted for the regulation of host genes. We argue that the inherent genetic properties of TEs and the conflicting relationships with their hosts facilitate their recruitment for regulatory functions in diverse genomes. We review recent findings supporting the long-standing hypothesis that the waves of TE invasions endured by organisms for eons have catalysed the evolution of gene-regulatory networks. We also discuss the challenges of dissecting and interpreting the phenotypic effect of regulatory activities encoded by TEs in health and disease.},

abstract = {Aminoacylated (charged) transfer RNA isoacceptors read different messenger RNA codons for the same amino acid. The concentration of an isoacceptor and its charged fraction are principal determinants of the translation rate of its codons. A recent theoretical model predicts that amino-acid starvation results in 'selective charging' where the charging levels of some tRNA isoacceptors will be low and those of others will remain high. Here, we developed a microarray for the analysis of charged fractions of tRNAs and measured charging for all Escherichia coli tRNAs before and during leucine, threonine or arginine starvation. Before starvation, most tRNAs were fully charged. During starvation, the isoacceptors in the leucine, threonine or arginine families showed selective charging when cells were starved for their cognate amino acid, directly confirming the theoretical prediction. Codons read by isoacceptors that retain high charging can be used for efficient translation of genes that are essential during amino-acid starvation. Selective charging can explain anomalous patterns of codon usage in the genes for different families of proteins. {\textcopyright} 2005 European Molecular Biology Organization.},

abstract = {The ubiquitous bacterial second messenger c-di-GMP controls exopolysaccharide synthesis, flagella- and pili-based motility, gene expression, and interactions of bacteria with eukaryotic hosts. With the exception of bacterial cellulose synthases, the identities of c-di-GMP receptors and end targets have remained unknown. Recently, Amikam and Galperin (Amikam, D., and Galperin, M. (2006) Bioinformatics 22, 3-6) hypothesized that the PilZ domains present in the BcsA subunits of bacterial cellulose synthases function in c-di-GMP binding. This hypothesis has been tested here using the Escherichia coli PilZ domain protein YcgR, its individual PilZ domain and the PilZ domain from Gluconacetobacter xylinus BcsA. YcgR was purified and found to bind c-di-GMP tightly and specifically, Kd 0.84 microm. Individual PilZ domains from YcgR and BcsA also bound c-di-GMP, albeit with lesser affinity, indicating that PilZ is sufficient for binding. The site-directed mutagenesis performed on YcgR implicated the most conserved residues in the PilZ domain directly in c-di-GMP binding. It is suggested that c-di-GMP binding to PilZ brings about conformational changes in the protein that stabilize the bound ligand and initiate the downstream signal transduction cascade. While the identity of the downstream partner(s) of YcgR remains unknown, it is shown that YcgR regulates flagellum-based motility in a c-di-GMP-dependent manner. The inactivation of ycgR improves swimming and swarming motility of the poorly motile yhjH mutants of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium UMR1. Therefore, biochemical and genetic evidence presented here establishes PilZ as a long sought after c-di-GMP-binding domain and YcgR as a c-di-GMP receptor affecting motility in enterobacteria.},

A million copies of the Alu short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) are scattered throughout the human genome, providing {\~{}}11{\%} of our total DNA. SINEs spread by retrotransposition, using a transcript generated by RNA polymerase (pol) III from an internal promoter. Levels of these pol IIIdependent Alu transcripts are far lower than might be expected from the abundance of the template. This was believed to reflect transcriptional suppression through DNA methylation, denying pol III access to most SINEs through chromatin- mediated effects. Contrary to expectations, our recent study found no evidence that methylation of SINE DNA reduces its occupancy or expression by pol III. However, histone H3 associated with SINEs is prominently methylated on lysine 9, a mark that correlates with transcriptional silencing. The SUV39 methyltransferases that deposit this mark can be found at many SINEs. Furthermore, a selective inhibitor of SUV39 stimulates pol III recruitment to these loci, as well as SINE expression. These data suggest that methylation of histone H3 rather than DNA may mediate repression of SINE transcription by pol III, at least under the conditions we studied.},

abstract = {Bacteria glide across solid surfaces by mechanisms that have remained largely mysterious despite decades of research. In the deltaproteobacterium Myxococcus xanthus, this locomotion allows the formation stress-resistant fruiting bodies where sporulation takes place. However, despite the large number of genes identified as important for gliding, no specific machinery has been identified so far, hampering in-depth investigations. Based on the premise that components of the gliding machinery must have co-evolved and encode both envelope-spanning proteins and a molecular motor, we re-annotated known gliding motility genes and examined their taxonomic distribution, genomic localization, and phylogeny. We successfully delineated three functionally related genetic clusters, which we proved experimentally carry genes encoding the basal gliding machinery in M. xanthus, using genetic and localization techniques. For the first time, this study identifies structural gliding motility genes in the Myxobacteria and opens new perspectives to study the motility mechanism. Furthermore, phylogenomics provide insight into how this machinery emerged from an ancestral conserved core of genes of unknown function that evolved to gliding by the recruitment of functional modules in Myxococcales. Surprisingly, this motility machinery appears to be highly related to a sporulation system, underscoring unsuspected common mechanisms in these apparently distinct morphogenic phenomena.},

abstract = {We recently reported that circular RNA is efficiently translated by a rolling circle amplification (RCA) mechanism in a cell-free Escherichia coli translation system. Recent studies have shown that circular RNAs composed of exonic sequences are abundant in human cells. However, whether these circular RNAs can be translated into proteins within cells remains unclear. In this study, we prepared circular RNAs with an infinite open reading frame and tested their translation in eukaryotic systems. Circular RNAs were translated into long proteins in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the absence of any particular element for internal ribosome entry, a poly-A tail, or a cap structure. The translation systems in eukaryote can accept much simpler RNA as a template for protein synthesis by cyclisation. Here, we demonstrated that the circular RNA is efficiently translated in living human cells to produce abundant protein product by RCA mechanism. These findings suggest that translation of exonic circular RNAs present in human cells is more probable than previously thought.},

abstract = {N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most abundant modification in mammalian mRNA and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA). Recent discoveries of two m(6)A demethylases and cell-type and cell-state-dependent m(6)A patterns indicate that m(6)A modifications are highly dynamic and likely play important biological roles for RNA akin to DNA methylation or histone modification. Proposed functions for m(6)A modification include mRNA splicing, export, stability, and immune tolerance; but m(6)A studies have been hindered by the lack of methods for its identification at single nucleotide resolution. Here, we develop a method that accurately determines m(6)A status at any site in mRNA/lncRNA, termed site-specific cleavage and radioactive-labeling followed by ligation-assisted extraction and thin-layer chromatography (SCARLET). The method determines the precise location of the m(6)A residue and its modification fraction, which are crucial parameters in probing the cellular dynamics of m(6)A modification. We applied the method to determine the m(6)A status at several sites in two human lncRNAs and three human mRNAs and found that m(6)A fraction varies between 6{\%} and 80{\%} among these sites. We also found that many m(6)A candidate sites in these RNAs are however not modified. The precise determination of m(6)A status in a long noncoding RNA also enables the identification of an m(6)A-containing RNA structural motif.},

abstract = {Limitation for amino acids is thought to regulate translation in mammalian cells primarily by signaling through the kinases mTORC1 and GCN2. We find that limitation for the amino acid arginine causes a selective loss of tRNA charging, which regulates translation through ribosome pausing at two of six arginine codons. Surprisingly, limitation for leucine, an essential and abundant amino acid in protein, results in little or no ribosome pausing. Chemical and genetic perturbation of mTORC1 and GCN2 signaling revealed that their robust response to leucine limitation prevents ribosome pausing, while an insufficient response to arginine limitation led to loss of arginine tRNA charging and ribosome pausing. Codon-specific ribosome pausing decreased protein production and triggered premature ribosome termination without significantly reducing mRNA levels. Together, our results suggest that amino acids which are not optimally sensed by the mTORC1 and GCN2 pathways still regulate translation through an evolutionarily conserved mechanism based on codon-specific ribosome pausing.},

abstract = {Background Long-term disorders are the main challenge facing health-care systems worldwide, but health systems are largely configured for individual diseases rather than multimorbidity. We examined the distribution of multimorbidity, and of comorbidity of physical and mental health disorders, in relation to age and socioeconomic deprivation. Methods In a cross-sectional study we extracted data on 40 morbidities from a database of 1 751 841 people registered with 314 medical practices in Scotland as of March, 2007. We analysed the data according to the number of morbidities, disorder type (physical or mental), sex, age, and socioeconomic status. We defined multimorbidity as the presence of two or more disorders. Findings 42.2{\%} (95{\%} CI 42.1-42.3) of all patients had one or more morbidities, and 23.2{\%} (23.08-23.21) were multimorbid. Although the prevalence of multimorbidity increased substantially with age and was present in most people aged 65 years and older, the absolute number of people with multimorbidity was higher in those younger than 65 years (210 500 vs 194 996). Onset of multimorbidity occurred 10-15 years earlier in people living in the most deprived areas compared with the most affluent, with socioeconomic deprivation particularly associated with multimorbidity that included mental health disorders (prevalence of both physical and mental health disorder 11.0{\%}, 95{\%} CI 10.9-11.2{\%} in most deprived area vs 5.9{\%}, 5.8{\%}-6.0{\%} in least deprived). The presence of a mental health disorder increased as the number of physical morbidities increased (adjusted odds ratio 6.74, 95{\%} CI 6.59-6.90 for five or more disorders vs 1.95, 1.93-1.98 for one disorder), and was much greater in more deprived than in less deprived people (2.28, 2.21-2.32 vs 1.08, 1.05-1.11). Interpretation Our findings challenge the single-disease framework by which most health care, medical research, and medical education is configured. A complementary strategy is needed, supporting generalist clinicians to provide personalised, comprehensive continuity of care, especially in socioeconomically deprived areas.

abstract = {Genome instability has long been implicated as the main causal factor in aging. Somatic cells are continuously exposed to various sources of DNA damage, from reactive oxygen species to UV radiation to environmental mutagens. To cope with the tens of thousands of chemical lesions introduced into the genome of a typical cell each day, a complex network of genome maintenance systems acts to remove damage and restore the correct base pair sequence. Occasionally, however, repair is erroneous, and such errors, as well as the occasional failure to correctly replicate the genome during cell division, are the basis for mutations and epimutations. There is now ample evidence that mutations accumulate in various organs and tissues of higher animals, including humans, mice, and flies. What is not known, however, is whether the frequency of these random changes is sufficient to cause the phenotypic effects generally associated with aging. The exception is cancer, an age-related disease caused by the accumulation of mutations and epimutations. Here, we first review current concepts regarding the relationship between DNA damage, repair, and mutation, as well as the data regarding genome alterations as a function of age. We then describe a model for how randomly induced DNA sequence and epigenomic variants in the somatic genomes of animals can result in functional decline and disease in old age. Finally, we discuss the genetics of genome instability in relation to longevity to address the importance of alterations in the somatic genome as a causal factor in aging and to underscore the opportunities provided by genetic approaches to develop interventions that attenuate genome instability, reduce disease risk, and increase life span.

abstract = {Codon usage bias affects protein translation because tRNAs that recognize synonymous codons differ in their abundance. Although the current dogma states that tRNA expression is exclusively regulated by intrinsic control elements (A- and B-box sequences), we revealed, using a reporter that monitors the levels of individual tRNA genes in Caenorhabditis elegans, that eight tryptophan tRNA genes, 100{\%} identical in sequence, are expressed in different tissues and change their expression dynamically. Furthermore, the expression levels of the sup-7 tRNA gene at day 6 were found to predict the animal's lifespan. We discovered that the expression of tRNAs that reside within introns of protein-coding genes is affected by the host gene's promoter. Pairing between specific Pol II genes and the tRNAs that are contained in their introns is most likely adaptive, since a genome-wide analysis revealed that the presence of specific intronic tRNAs within specific orthologous genes is conserved across Caenorhabditis species.},

abstract = {Telomere length (TL) is associated with several aging-related diseases. Here, we present a DNA methylation estimator of TL (DNAmTL) based on 140 CpGs. Leukocyte DNAmTL is applicable across the entire age spectrum and is more strongly associated with age than measured leukocyte TL (LTL) (r {\~{}}-0.75 for DNAmTL versus r {\~{}} -0.35 for LTL). Leukocyte DNAmTL outperforms LTL in predicting: i) time-to-death (p=2.5E-20), ii) time-to-coronary heart disease (p=6.6E-5), iii) time-to-congestive heart failure (p=3.5E-6), and iv) association with smoking history (p=1.21E-17). These associations are further validated in large scale methylation data (n=10k samples) from the Framingham Heart Study, Women's Health Initiative, Jackson Heart Study, InChianti, Lothian Birth Cohorts, Twins UK, and Bogalusa Heart Study. Leukocyte DNAmTL is also associated with measures of physical fitness/functioning (p=0.029), age-at-menopause (p=0.039), dietary variables (omega 3, fish, vegetable intake), educational attainment (p=3.3E-8) and income (p=3.1E-5). Experiments in cultured somatic cells show that DNAmTL dynamics reflect in part cell replication rather than TL per se. DNAmTL is not only an epigenetic biomarker of replicative history of cells, but a useful marker of age-related pathologies that are associated with it.},

abstract = {Hypermethylation associated silencing of the CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes is a common hallmark of human cancer. Here we report a functional search for hypermethylated CpG islands using the colorectal cancer cell line HCT-116, in which two major DNA methyltransferases, DNMT1 and DNMT3b, have been genetically disrupted (DKO cells). Using two molecular screenings for differentially methylated loci [differential methylation hybridization (DMH) and amplification of inter-methylated sites (AIMS)], we found that DKO cells, but not the single DNMT1 or DNMT3b knockouts, have a massive loss of hypermethylated CpG islands that induces the re-activation of the contiguous genes. We have characterized a substantial number of these CpG island associated genes with potentially important roles in tumorigenesis, such as the cadherin member FAT, or the homeobox genes LMX-1 and DUX-4. For other genes whose role in transformation has not been characterized, such as the calcium channel alpha1I or the thromboxane A2 receptor, their re-introduction in DKO cells inhibited colony formation. Thus, our results demonstrate the role of DNMT1 and DNMT3b in CpG island methylation associated silencing and the usefulness of genetic disruption strategies in searching for new hypermethylated loci.},

abstract = {Expression of the initiator methionine tRNA (tRNAiMet) is deregulated in cancer. Despite this fact, it is not currently known how tRNAiMet expression levels influence tumor progression. We have found that tRNAiMet expression is increased in carcinoma-associated fibroblasts, implicating deregulated expression of tRNAiMet in the tumor stroma as a possible contributor to tumor progression. To investigate how elevated stromal tRNAiMet contributes to tumor progression, we generated a mouse expressing additional copies of the tRNAiMet gene (2+tRNAiMet mouse). Growth and vascularization of subcutaneous tumor allografts was enhanced in 2+tRNAiMet mice compared with wild-type littermate controls. Extracellular matrix (ECM) deposited by fibroblasts from 2+tRNAiMet mice supported enhanced endothelial cell and fibroblast migration. SILAC mass spectrometry indicated that elevated expression of tRNAiMet significantly increased synthesis and secretion of certain types of collagen, in particular type II collagen. Suppression of type II collagen opposed the ability of tRNAiMet-overexpressing fibroblasts to deposit pro-migratory ECM. We used the prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor ethyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (DHB) to determine whether collagen synthesis contributes to the tRNAiMet-driven pro-tumorigenic stroma in vivo. DHB had no effect on the growth of syngeneic allografts in wild-type mice but opposed the ability of 2+tRNAiMet mice to support increased angiogenesis and tumor growth. Finally, collagen II expression predicts poor prognosis in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma. Taken together, these data indicate that increased tRNAiMet levels contribute to tumor progression by enhancing the ability of stromal fibroblasts to synthesize and secrete a type II collagen-rich ECM that supports endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis.},

@article{Rodriguez-Rigueiro2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The dynamic regulation of cell-cell adhesions is crucial for developmental processes, including tissue formation, differentiation and motility. Adherens junctions are important components of the junctional complex between cells and are necessary for maintaining cell homeostasis and normal tissue architecture. E-cadherin is the prototype and best-characterized protein member of adherens junctions in mammalian epithelial cells. Regarded as a tumour suppressor, E-cadherin loss is associated with poor prognosis in carcinoma. The E3 ubiquitin-ligase Hakai was the first reported posttranslational regulator of the E-cadherin complex. Hakai specifically targetted E-cadherin for internalization and degradation and thereby lowered epithelial cell-cell contact. Hakai was also implicated in controlling proliferation, and promoted cancer-related gene expression by increasing the binding of RNA-binding protein PSF to RNAs encoding oncogenic proteins. We sought to investigate the possible implication of Hakai in cell-substratum adhesions and invasion in epithelial cells. METHODS: Parental MDCK cells and MDCK cells stably overexpressing Hakai were used to analyse cell-substratum adhesion and invasion capabilities. Western blot and immunofluoresecence analyses were performed to assess the roles of Paxillin, FAK and Vinculin in cell-substratum adhesion. The role of the proteasome in controlling cell-substratum adhesion was studied using two proteasome inhibitors, lactacystin and MG132. To study the molecular mechanisms controlling Paxillin expression, MDCK cells expressing E-cadherin shRNA in a tetracycline-inducible manner was employed. RESULTS: Here, we present evidence that implicate Hakai in reducing cell-substratum adhesion and increasing epithelial cell invasion, two hallmark features of cancer progression and metastasis. Paxillin, an important protein component of the cell-matrix adhesion, was completely absent from focal adhesions and focal contacts in Hakai-overexpressing MDCK cells. The expression of Paxillin was found to be regulated by a proteasome-independent mechanism, possibly due to the decreased abundance of E-cadherin. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results suggest that Hakai may be involved in two hallmark aspects of tumour progression, the lowering cell-substratum adhesion and the enhancement of cell invasion.},

abstract = {The mechanism by which the recently identified DNA modification 5-formylcytosine ((f)C) is recognized by epigenetic writer and reader proteins is not known. Recently, an unusual DNA structure, F-DNA, has been proposed as the basis for enzyme recognition of clusters of (f)C. We used NMR and X-ray crystallography to compare several modified DNA duplexes with unmodified analogs and found that in the crystal state the duplexes all belong to the A family, whereas in solution they are all members of the B family. We found that, contrary to previous findings, (f)C does not significantly affect the structure of DNA, although there are modest local differences at the modification sites. Hence, global conformation changes are unlikely to account for the recognition of this modified base, and our structural data favor a mechanism that operates at base-pair resolution for the recognition of (f)C by epigenome-modifying enzymes.},

abstract = {We analyzed transcriptomic data from 452 healthy men and women representing five different human populations and two races, and, 311 breast cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Our studies revealed numerous constitutive, distinct fragments with overlapping sequences and quantized lengths that persist across dozens of individuals and arise from the genomic loci of all nuclear and mitochondrial human transfer RNAs (tRNAs). Surprisingly, we discovered that the tRNA fragments' length, starting and ending points, and relative abundance depend on gender, population, race and also on amino acid identity, anticodon, genomic locus, tissue, disease, and disease subtype. Moreover, the length distribution of mitochondriallyencoded tRNAs differs from that of nuclearly-encoded tRNAs, and the specifics of these distributions depend on tissue. Notably, tRNA fragments from the same anticodon do not have correlated abundances. We also report on a novel category of tRNA fragments that significantly contribute to the differences we observe across tissues, genders, populations, and races: these fragments, referred to as i-tRFs, are abundant in human tissues, wholly internal to the respective mature tRNA, and can straddle the anticodon. HITS-CLIP data analysis revealed that tRNA fragments are loaded on Argonaute in a cell-dependent manner, suggesting cell-dependent functional roles through the RNA interference pathway. We validated experimentally two i-tRF molecules: the first was found in 21 of 22 tested breast tumor and adjacent normal samples and was differentially abundant between health and disease whereas the second was found in all eight tested breast cancer cell lines.},

abstract = {RNA splicing is a highly regulated process dependent on sequences near splice sites. Insertions of Alu retrotransposons can disrupt splice sites or bind splicing regulators. We hypothesized that some common inherited polymorphic Alu insertions are responsible for splicing QTLs (sQTL). We focused on intronic Alu variants mapping within 100 bp of an alternatively used exon and screened for those that alter splicing. We identify five loci, 21.7{\%} of those assayed, where the polymorphic Alu alters splicing. While in most cases the Alu promotes exon skipping, at one locus the Alu increases exon inclusion. Of particular interest is an Alu polymorphism in the CD58 gene. Reduced CD58 expression is associated with risk for developing multiple sclerosis. We show that the Alu insertion promotes skipping of CD58 exon 3 and results in a frameshifted transcript, indicating that the Alu may be the causative variant for increased MS risk at this locus. Using RT-PCR analysis at the endogenous locus, we confirm that the Alu variant is a sQTL for CD58. In summary, altered splicing efficiency is a common functional consequence of Alu polymorphisms including at least one instance where the variant is implicated in disease risk. This work broadens our understanding of splicing regulatory sequences around exons.},

Despite a growing understanding of DUB biology at the structural and molecular level, little is known about the physiological importance of most DUBs. Here, we systematically identify DUBs encoded by the genome of Drosophila melanogaster and examine their physiological importance in vivo. Through domain analyses we uncovered 41 Drosophila DUBs, most of which have human orthologues. Systematic knockdown of the vast majority of DUBs throughout the fly or in specific cell types had dramatic consequences for Drosophila development, adult motility or longevity. Specific DUB subclasses proved to be particularly necessary during development, while others were important in adults. Several DUBs were indispensable in neurons or glial cells during developmental stages; knockdown of others perturbed the homeostasis of ubiquitinated proteins in adult flies, or had adverse effects on wing positioning as a result of neuronal requirements. We demonstrate the physiological significance of the DUB family of enzymes in intact animals, find that there is little functional redundancy among members of this family of proteases, and provide insight for future investigations to understand DUB biology at the molecular, cellular and organismal levels.},

The gold standard of these methods, whole genome bisulfite-sequencing (BS-seq), involves treatment of DNA with sodium bisulfite combined with subsequent high throughput sequencing. Using BS-seq, we generated a single-base-resolution methylome in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (in press). This BS-seq map was then used as the reference methylome to compare two alternative sequencing-based methylome assays (performed on the same donor of PBMCs): methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP-seq) and methyl-binding protein (MBD-seq). In our analysis, we found that MeDIP-seq and MBD-seq are complementary strategies, with MeDIP-seq more sensitive to highly methylated, high-CpG densities and MDB-seq more sensitive to highly methylated, moderate-CpG densities. Taking into account the size of a mammalian genome and the current expense of sequencing, we feel 3. gigabases (Gbp) 45. bp paired-end MeDIP-seq or MBD-seq uniquely mapped reads is the minimum requirement and cost-effective strategy for methylome pattern analysis. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In multicellular organisms, telomerase is required to maintain telomere length in the germline but is dispensable in the soma. Mice, for example, express telomerase in somatic and germline tissues, while humans express telomerase almost exclusively in the germline. As a result, when telomeres of human somatic cells reach a critical length the cells enter irreversible growth arrest called replicative senescence. Replicative senescence is believed to be an anticancer mechanism that limits cell proliferation. The difference between mice and humans led to the hypothesis that repression of telomerase in somatic cells has evolved as a tumor-suppressor adaptation in large, long-lived organisms. We tested whether regulation of telomerase activity coevolves with lifespan and body mass using comparative analysis of 15 rodent species with highly diverse lifespans and body masses. Here we show that telomerase activity does not coevolve with lifespan but instead coevolves with body mass: larger rodents repress telomerase activity in somatic cells. These results suggest that large body mass presents a greater risk of cancer than long lifespan, and large animals evolve repression of telomerase activity to mitigate that risk.},

abstract = {To date, the gold standard in methylome mapping has been bisulfite sequencing. In this method, DNA is chemically treated with sodium bisulfite, which results in the conversion of unmethylated cytosines to uracils, and the resulting uracils are ultimately sequenced as thymines (Figure 1). In contrast, the modified cytosines, 5mC and 5hmC, are resistant to bisulfite conversion, and are sequenced as cytosines (1). While the preparation of bisulfite libraries is relatively straightforward, the libraries have uneven genome coverage and therefore suffer from incomplete representation of cytosine methylation across genomes. This uneven coverage is the result of DNA damage and fragmentation, which is caused by the extreme temperatures and pH during bisulfite conversion. Sequenced bisulfite libraries typically have skewed GC bias plots, with a general under-representation of G-and C-containing dinucleotides and over-representation of AA-, AT-and TA-containing dinucleotides, as compared to a non-converted genome (2). Therefore, the damaged libraries do not adequately cover the genome, and can include many gaps with little or no coverage. Increasing the sequencing depth of these libraries can recover some missing information, but at steep sequencing costs. These bisulfite library limitations have driven the development of new approaches for studying methylomes.},

abstract = {The tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription factor that controls cellular growth and proliferation. p53 targets include RNA polymerase (pol) III-dependent genes encoding untranslated RNAs such as tRNA and 5S rRNA. These genes are repressed through interaction of p53 with TFIIIB, a TATA-binding protein (TBP)-containing factor. Although many studies have shown that p53 binds to TBP, the significance of this interaction has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate that the TBP-p53 interaction is of functional importance for regulating RNA pol III-transcribed genes. Unlike RNA pol II-dependent promoter repression, overexpressing TBP can reverse inhibition of tRNA gene transcription by p53. p53 does not disrupt the direct interaction between the TFIIIB subunits TBP and Brf1, but prevents the association of Brf1 complexes with TFIIIC2 and RNA pol III. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we found that TFIIIB occupancy on tRNA genes markedly decreases following p53 induction, whereas binding of TFIIIC2 to these genes is unaffected. Together our results support the idea that p53 represses RNA pol III transcription through direct interactions with TBP, preventing promoter occupancy by TFIIIB.},

abstract = {Efficient maturation of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) is required for rapid cell growth. However, the precise timing of tRNA processing in coordination with the order of tRNA modifications has not been thoroughly elucidated. To analyze the modification status of tRNA precursors (pre-tRNAs) during maturation, we isolated pre-tRNAs at various stages from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and subjected them to MS analysis. We detected methylated guanosine cap structures at the 5' termini of pre-tRNAs bearing 5' leader sequences. These capped pre-tRNAs accumulated substantially after inhibition of RNase P activity. Upon depletion of the capping enzyme Ceg1p, the steady state level of capped pre-tRNA was markedly reduced. In addition, a population of capped pre-tRNAs accumulated in strains in which 5' exonucleases were inhibited, indicating that the 5' cap structures protect pre-tRNAs from 5'-exonucleolytic degradation during maturation.},

abstract = {Most organisms have an endogenous circadian clock that is synchronized to environmental signals such as light and temperature. Although circadian rhythms have been described in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans at the behavioral level, these rhythms appear to be relatively non-robust. Moreover, in contrast to other animal models, no circadian transcriptional rhythms have been identified. Thus, whether this organism contains a bona fide circadian clock remains an open question. Here we use genome-wide expression profiling experiments to identify light- and temperature-entrained oscillating transcripts in C. elegans. These transcripts exhibit rhythmic expression with temperature-compensated 24-h periods. In addition, their expression is sustained under constant conditions, suggesting that they are under circadian regulation. Light and temperature cycles strongly drive gene expression and appear to entrain largely nonoverlapping gene sets. We show that mutations in a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel required for sensory transduction abolish both light- and temperature-entrained gene expression, implying that environmental cues act cell nonautonomously to entrain circadian rhythms. Together, these findings demonstrate circadian-regulated transcriptional rhythms in C. elegans and suggest that further analyses in this organism will provide new information about the evolution and function of this biological clock. {\textcopyright} 2010 van der Linden et al.},

abstract = {Ever since methylcytosine was found in genomic DNA, this epigenetic alteration has become a center of scientific attraction, especially because of its relation to gene silencing in disease. There is currently a wide range of methods designed to yield quantitative and qualitative information on genomic DNA methylation. The earliest approaches were concentrated on the study of overall levels of methylcytosine, but more recent efforts havefocused on the study ofthe methylation status of specific DNA sequences. Particularly, optimization of the methods based on bisulfite modification of DNA permits the analysis of limited CpGs in restriction enzyme sites (e.g., combined bisulfite restriction analyses and methylation-sensitive single nucleotide primer extension) and the overall characterization based on differential methylation states (e.g., methylation-specific PCR, MethyLight, and methylation-sensitive single-stranded conformational polymorphism) and allows very specific patterns of methylation to be revealed (bisulfite DNA sequencing). In addition, novel methods designed to search for new methylcytosine hot spots have yielded further data without requiring prior knowledge of the DNA sequence. We hope this review will be a valuable tool in selecting the best techniques to address particular questions concerning the cytosine methylation status of genomic DNA.},

Here we show that a tRNA(Asp) isodecoder, corresponding to a human tRNA-derived sequence, binds to an embedded Alu RNA element contained in the 3' UTR of the human aspartyl-tRNA synthetase mRNA. This interaction between two well-known classes of RNA molecules, tRNA and Alu RNA, is driven by an unexpected structural motif and induces a global rearrangement of the 3' UTR. Besides, this 3' UTR contains two functional polyadenylation signals. We propose a model where the tRNA/Alu interaction would modulate the accessibility of the two alternative polyadenylation sites and regulate the stability of the mRNA. This unique regulation mechanism would link gene expression to RNA polymerase III transcription and may have implications in a primate-specific signal pathway.},

The overall rate at which damage accumulates is influenced by conserved metabolic factors (longevity pathways and regulatory proteins), which control life span through adjusting mechanisms for maintenance and repair. Autophagy, the major catabolic process of eukaryotic cells, which has the capacity to degrade and recycle damaged macromolecules and organelles, is implicated in aging and in the incidence of diverse age-related pathologies. Recent evidence shows further that autophagic activity is required for life span extension in various long- lived mutant organisms, and that numerous autophagy-related genes or proteins serve as targets that longevity pathways regulate directly. These findings support the emerging view that autophagy acts as a central regulatory mechanism of aging in divergent eukaryotic species.},

To address this issue, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) of newborn and centenarian genomes. The centenarian DNA had a lower DNA methylation content and a reduced correlation in the methylation status of neighboring cytosine—phosphate—guanine (CpGs) throughout the genome in comparison with the more homogeneously methylated newborn DNA. The more hypomethylated CpGs observed in the centenarian DNA compared with the neonate covered all genomic compartments, such as promoters, exonic, intronic, and intergenic regions. For regulatory regions, the most hypomethylated sequences in the centenarian DNA were present mainly at CpG-poor promoters and in tissue-specific genes, whereas a greater level of DNA methylation was observed in CpG island promoters. We extended the study to a larger cohort of newborn and nonagenarian samples using a 450,000 CpG-site DNA methylation microarray that reinforced the observation of more hypomethylated DNA sequences in the advanced age group. WGBS and 450,000 analyses of middle-age individuals demonstrated DNA methylomes in the crossroad between the newborn and the nonagenarian/centenarian groups.

abstract = {Age-associated chronic inflammation (inflammageing) is a central hallmark of ageing1, but its influence on specific cells remains largely unknown. Fibroblasts are present in most tissues and contribute to wound healing2,3. They are also the most widely used cell type for reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, a process that has implications for regenerative medicine and rejuvenation strategies4. Here we show that fibroblast cultures from old mice secrete inflammatory cytokines and exhibit increased variability in the efficiency of iPS cell reprogramming between mice. Variability between individuals is emerging as a feature of old age5–8, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. To identify drivers of this variability, we performed multi-omics profiling of fibroblast cultures from young and old mice that have different reprogramming efficiencies. This approach revealed that fibroblast cultures from old mice contain ‘activated fibroblasts' that secrete inflammatory cytokines, and that the proportion of activated fibroblasts in a culture correlates with the reprogramming efficiency of that culture. Experiments in which conditioned medium was swapped between cultures showed that extrinsic factors secreted by activated fibroblasts underlie part of the variability between mice in reprogramming efficiency, and we have identified inflammatory cytokines, including TNF, as key contributors. Notably, old mice also exhibited variability in wound healing rate in vivo. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis identified distinct subpopulations of fibroblasts with different cytokine expression and signalling in the wounds of old mice with slow versus fast healing rates. Hence, a shift in fibroblast composition, and the ratio of inflammatory cytokines that they secrete, may drive the variability between mice in reprogramming in vitro and influence wound healing rate in vivo. This variability may reflect distinct stochastic ageing trajectories between individuals, and could help in developing personalized strategies to improve iPS cell generation and wound healing in elderly individuals.},

abstract = {There is increasing interest in understanding the processes that maintain phenotypic variation in groups, populations, or communities. Recent studies have investigated how the phenotypic composition of groups or aggregations (e.g., its average phenotype or phenotypic variance) affects ecological and social processes, and how multi-level selection can drive phenotypic covariance among interacting individuals. However, we argue that these questions are rarely studied together. We present a unified framework to address this gap, and discuss how group phenotypic composition (GPC) can impact on processes ranging from individual fitness to population demography. By emphasising the breadth of topics affected, we hope to motivate more integrated empirical studies of the ecological and evolutionary implications of GPC. Members of animal groups often vary in their phenotypes (e.g., personality, morphology). Many recent studies have shown how different aspects (e.g., phenotypic average, variation, extreme) of GPC affect group-level outcomes (e.g., foraging success, mating system). Group-level outcomes can shape selection when individual and group phenotypes co-vary. Selection arising from GPC can drive changes in traits that affect aspects of individual-to-group covariance, such as behaviours that determine group membership or by changing the expression of traits (via phenotypic plasticity or indirect genetic effects). A framework based on interacting phenotype theory can quantify the selective consequences and evaluate the evolutionary implications of GPC. This framework is still largely unexplored empirically but it is applicable to many topics in evolutionary biology.},

abstract = {The cell cycle is regulated by various protein kinases, including cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). D-type CDKs, CDK4, and CDK6, phosphorylate retinoblastoma protein and are believed to regulate through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. CDK inhibitor p16INK4A has been characterized as binding CDK4 and CDK6 and as inhibiting phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein by these CDKs. Thus p16INK4A is implicated in regulating the cell cycle at the G1 phase. The largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (pol II) contains an essential C-terminal domain (CTD). General transcription factor TFIIH, which contains CDK7, phosphorylates the CTD in vitro. The CTD phosphorylation is shown to be involved in transcriptional regulation in vivo and in vitro. Phosphorylation of RNA pol II CTD by TFIIH is thought to play an important role in transcriptional regulation. Here we report that p16INK4A associates with RNA pol II CTD and TFIIH. p16(INK4A) inhibited the CTD phosphorylation by TFIIH. These findings suggest that p16INK4A may regulate transcription via CTD phosphorylation in the cell cycle.},

abstract = {Chromatin is not an inert structure, but rather an instructive DNA scaffold that can respond to external cues to regulate the many uses of DNA. A principle component of chromatin that plays a key role in this regulation is the modification of histones. There is an ever-growing list of these modifications and the complexity of their action is only just beginning to be understood. However, it is clear that histone modifications play fundamental roles in most biological processes that are involved in the manipulation and expression of DNA. Here, we describe the known histone modifications, define where they are found genomically and discuss some of their functional consequences, concentrating mostly on transcription where the majority of characterisation has taken place.},

Here, we find substantial hypermethylation and hypomethylation of cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) island shores in nine human iPS cell lines as compared to their parental fibroblasts. The differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the reprogrammed cells (denoted R-DMRs) were significantly enriched in tissue-specific (T-DMRs; 2.6-fold, P {\textless} 10−4) and cancer-specific DMRs (C-DMRs; 3.6-fold, P {\textless} 10−4). Notably, even though the iPS cells are derived from fibroblasts, their R-DMRs can distinguish between normal brain, liver and spleen cells and between colon cancer and normal colon cells. Thus, many DMRs are broadly involved in tissue differentiation, epigenetic reprogramming and cancer. We observed colocalization of hypomethylated R-DMRs with hypermethylated C-DMRs and bivalent chromatin marks, and colocalization of hypermethylated R-DMRs with hypomethylated C-DMRs and the absence of bivalent marks, suggesting two mechanisms for epigenetic reprogramming in iPS cells and cancer.},

abstract = {The currently-accepted dogma when analysing human Alu transposable elements is that 'young' Alu elements are found in low GC regions and 'old' Alus in high GC regions. The correlation between high GC regions and high gene frequency regions make this observation particularly difficult to explain. Although a number of studies have tackled the problem, no analysis has definitively explained the reason for this trend. These observations have been made by relying on the subfamily as a proxy for age of an element. In this study, we suggest that this is a misleading assumption and instead analyse the relationship between the taxonomic distribution of an individual element and its surrounding GC environment. An analysis of 103906 Alu elements across 6 human chromosomes was carried out, using the presence of orthologous Alu elements in other primate species as a proxy for age. We show that the previously-reported effect of GC content correlating with subfamily age is not reflected by the ages of the individual elements. Instead, elements are preferentially lost from areas of high GC content over time. The correlation between GC content and subfamily may be due to a change in insertion bias in the young subfamilies. The link between Alu subfamily age and GC region was made due to an over-simplification of the data and is incorrect. We suggest that use of subfamilies as a proxy for age is inappropriate and that the analysis of ortholog presence in other primate species provides a deeper insight into the data.},

abstract = {In C. elegans, miRNAs are genetic biomarkers of aging. Similarly, multiple miRNAs are differentially expressed between younger and older persons, suggesting that miRNA-regulated biological mechanisms affecting aging are evolutionarily conserved. Previous human studies have not considered participants' lifespans, a key factor in identifying biomarkers of aging. Using PCR arrays, we measured miRNA levels from serum samples obtained longitudinally at ages 50, 55, and 60 from 16 non-Hispanic males who had documented lifespans from 58 to 92. Numerous miRNAs showed significant changes in expression levels. At age 50, 24 miRNAs were significantly upregulated, and 73 were significantly downregulated in the long-lived subgroup (76-92 years) as compared with the short-lived subgroup (58-75 years). In long-lived participants, the most upregulated was miR-373-5p, while the most downregulated was miR-15b-5p. Longitudinally, significant Pearson correlations were observed between lifespan and expression of nine miRNAs (p value {\textless} 0.05). Six of these nine miRNAs (miR-211-5p, 374a-5p, 340-3p, 376c-3p, 5095, 1225-3p) were also significantly up- or downregulated when comparing long-lived and short-lived participants. Twenty-four validated targets of these miRNAs encoded aging-associated proteins, including PARP1, IGF1R, and IGF2R. We propose that the expression profiles of the six miRNAs (miR-211-5p, 374a-5p, 340-3p, 376c-3p, 5095, and 1225-3p) may be useful biomarkers of aging.},

abstract = {Early growth is associated with later risk of osteoporosis and fractures. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the relationships between maternal lifestyle and body composition and neonatal bone size, geometry and density in the offspring. Participants were recruited from the Southampton Women's Survey, a unique prospective cohort of 12,500 initially non-pregnant women aged 20–34 years, resident in Southampton, UK. These women were studied in detail before and during pregnancy, and the offspring underwent anthropometric and bone mineral assessment (using dual energy-X-ray absorptiometry) at birth. A total of 841 mother–baby pairs were studied (443 boys and 398 girls). The independent predictors of greater neonatal whole body bone area (BA) and bone mineral content included greater maternal birthweight, height, parity, triceps skinfold thickness and lower walking speed in late pregnancy. Maternal smoking was independently associated with lower neonatal bone mass. Neonatal BA adjusted for birth length (a measure of bone width) was predicted positively by maternal parity and late pregnancy triceps skinfold thickness and negatively by late pregnancy walking speed. These findings were similar in both genders. We have confirmed, in a large cohort, previous findings that maternal lifestyle and body build predict neonatal bone mineral; additionally, maternal parity and fat stores and walking speed in late pregnancy were associated with neonatal bone geometry. These findings may suggest novel public health strategies to reduce the burden of osteoporotic fracture in future generations. {\textcopyright} 2009, Cambridge University Press and the International Society for Developmental Origins of Health and Disease.

abstract = {Tissue mechanics drive morphogenesis, but how forces are sensed and transmitted to control stem cell fate and self-organization remains unclear. We show that a mechanosensory complex of emerin (Emd), non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA) and actin controls gene silencing and chromatin compaction, thereby regulating lineage commitment. Force-driven enrichment of Emd at the outer nuclear membrane of epidermal stem cells leads to defective heterochromatin anchoring to the nuclear lamina and a switch from H3K9me2,3 to H3K27me3 occupancy at constitutive heterochromatin. Emd enrichment is accompanied by the recruitment of NMIIA to promote local actin polymerization that reduces nuclear actin levels, resulting in attenuation of transcription and subsequent accumulation of H3K27me3 at facultative heterochromatin. Perturbing this mechanosensory pathway by deleting NMIIA in mouse epidermis leads to attenuated H3K27me3-mediated silencing and precocious lineage commitment, abrogating morphogenesis. Our results reveal how mechanics integrate nuclear architecture and chromatin organization to control lineage commitment and tissue morphogenesis.},

We show that this interaction is necessary for TET1 to rescue hematopoetic stem cell production in tet mutant zebrafish embryos, suggesting that OGT promotes TET1's function during development. Finally, we show that disrupting the TET1-OGT interaction in mouse embryonic stem cells changes the abundance of TET2 and 5-methylcytosine, which is accompanied by alterations in gene expression.

abstract = {Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), their antagonists, and BMP receptors are involved in controlling a large number of biological functions including cell proliferation, differentiation, cell fate decision, and apoptosis in many different types of cells and tissues during embryonic development and postnatal life. BMPs exert their biological effects via using BMP-Smad and BMP-MAPK intracellular pathways. The magnitude and specificity of BMP signaling are regulated by a large number of modulators operating on several levels (extracellular, cytoplasmic, nuclear). In developing and postnatal skin, BMPs, their receptors, and BMP antagonists show stringent spatio-temporal expressions patterns to achieve proper regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation in the epidermis and in the hair follicle. Genetic studies assert an essential role for BMP signaling in the control of cell differentiation and apoptosis in developing epidermis, as well as in the regulation of key steps of hair follicle development (initiation, cell fate decision, cell lineage differentiation). In postnatal hair follicles, BMP signaling plays an important role in controlling the initiation of the growth phase and is also involved in the regulation of apoptosis-driven hair follicle involution. However, additional efforts are required to fully understand the mechanisms and targets involved in the realization of BMP effects on distinct cell population in the skin and hair follicle. Progress in this area of research will hopefully lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches for using BMPs and BMP antagonists in the treatment of skin and hair growth disorders.},

abstract = {Alu elements belong to the primate-specific SINE family of retrotransposons and constitute almost 11{\%} of the human genome. Alus are transcribed by RNA polymerase (Pol) III and are inserted back into the genome with the help of autonomous LINE retroelements. Since Alu elements are preferentially located near to or within gene-rich regions, they can affect gene expression by distinct mechanisms of action at both DNA and RNA levels. In this review we focus on recent advances of how Alu elements are pervasively involved in gene regulation. We discuss the impacts of Alu DNA sequences that are in close proximity to genes, Pol-III-transcribed free Alu RNAs, and Pol-II-transcribed Alu RNAs that are embedded within coding or noncoding RNA transcripts. The recent elucidation of Alu functions reveals previously underestimated roles of these selfish or junk DNA sequences in the human genome. Primate-specific Alus constitute 11{\%} of the human genome, with {\textgreater}1 million copies, and their genomic distribution is biased toward gene-rich regions. The functions of Alus are highly associated with their sequence and structural features. Alus can regulate gene expression by serving as cis elements. Pol-III-transcribed free Alus mainly affect Pol II transcription and mRNA translation in trans. Embedded Alus within Pol-II-transcribed mRNAs can impact their host gene expression through the regulation of alternative splicing, and RNA stability and translation. Nearly half of annotated Alus are located in introns; RNA pairing formed by orientation-opposite Alus across introns promotes circRNA biogenesis.},

abstract = {The eukaryotic defense response posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) is directed by short-interfering RNAs and thwarts invading nucleic acids via the RNA slicing activity of conserved ARGONAUTE (AGO) proteins. PTGS can be counteracted by exogenous or endogenous suppressors, including the cytoplasmic exoribonuclease XRN4, which also degrades microRNA (miRNA)-guided mRNA cleavage products but does not play an obvious role in development. Here, we show that the nuclear exoribonucleases XRN2 and XRN3 are endogenous PTGS suppressors. We also identify excised MIRNA loops as templates for XRN2 and XRN3 and show that XRN3 is critical for proper development. Independently, we identified the nucleotidase/phosphatase FIERY1 (FRY1) as an endogenous PTGS suppressor through a suppressor screen in a hypomorphic ago1 genetic background. FRY1 is one of six Arabidopsis thaliana orthologs of yeast Hal2. Yeast hal2 mutants overaccumulate 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate, which suppresses the 5'--{\textgreater}3' exoribonucleases Xrn1 and Rat1. fry1 mutant plants recapitulate developmental and molecular characteristics of xrn mutants and likely restore PTGS in ago1 hypomorphic mutants by corepressing XRN2, XRN3, and XRN4, thus increasing RNA silencing triggers. We anticipate that screens incorporating partially compromised silencing components will uncover additional PTGS suppressors that may not be revealed using robust silencing systems.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Epigenetic change is a hallmark of ageing but its link to ageing mechanisms in humans remains poorly understood. While DNA methylation at many CpG sites closely tracks chronological age, DNA methylation changes relevant to biological age are expected to gradually dissociate from chronological age, mirroring the increased heterogeneity in health status at older ages. RESULTS Here, we report on the large-scale identification of 6366 age-related variably methylated positions (aVMPs) identified in 3295 whole blood DNA methylation profiles, 2044 of which have a matching RNA-seq gene expression profile. aVMPs are enriched at polycomb repressed regions and, accordingly, methylation at those positions is associated with the expression of genes encoding components of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in trans. Further analysis revealed trans-associations for 1816 aVMPs with an additional 854 genes. These trans-associated aVMPs are characterized by either an age-related gain of methylation at CpG islands marked by PRC2 or a loss of methylation at enhancers. This distinct pattern extends to other tissues and multiple cancer types. Finally, genes associated with aVMPs in trans whose expression is variably upregulated with age (733 genes) play a key role in DNA repair and apoptosis, whereas downregulated aVMP-associated genes (121 genes) are mapped to defined pathways in cellular metabolism. CONCLUSIONS Our results link age-related changes in DNA methylation to fundamental mechanisms that are thought to drive human ageing.},

abstract = {Maf1 was the first protein discovered to regulate polymerase III RNA in yeast and because it is evolutionarily conserved, a Maf1 ortholog also serves to restrain transcription in mouse and human cells. Understanding the mechanism of the regulation has been made possible by recent studies showing that Maf1 is a nuclear/cytoplasmic protein whose subcellular distribution and hence negative regulation of Pol III transcription is mediated by the nutrient-sensing signaling pathways, TOR and RAS. Under stress conditions and during growth in a nonfermentable carbon source Maf1 is dephosphorylated and imported to the nucleus. In its non-phosphorylated form, Maf1 interacts with the polymerase III transcription machinery. Phosphorylation serves to locate Maf1 to the cytoplasm under favorable growth conditions, thereby preventing it from non-negatively regulating polymerase III when high levels of tRNA transcription are required. Relocation of Maf1 to the cytoplasm is dependent on Msn5, a carrier responsible for export of several other phosphoproteins out of the nucleus. The absence of Maf1-mediated control of tRNA synthesis impairs yeast viability in nonfermentable carbon sources. Moreover, in cells grown in a nonfermentable carbon source, Maf1 regulates the levels of different tRNAs to various extents. This differential regulation may contribute to the physiological role of Maf1.},

abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are widespread circles of non-coding RNAs with largely unknown function. Because stimulation of mammary cells with the epidermal growth factor (EGF) leads to dynamic changes in the abundance of coding and non-coding RNA molecules, and culminates in the acquisition of a robust migratory phenotype, this cellular model might disclose functions of circRNAs. Here we show that circRNAs of EGF-stimulated mammary cells are stably expressed, while mRNAs and microRNAs change within minutes. In general, the circRNAs we detected are relatively long-lived and weakly expressed. Interestingly, they are almost ubiquitously co-expressed with the corresponding linear transcripts, and the respective, shared promoter regions are more active compared to genes producing linear isoforms with no detectable circRNAs. These findings imply that altered abundance of circRNAs, unlike changes in the levels of other RNAs, might not play critical roles in signaling cascades and downstream transcriptional networks that rapidly commit cells to specific outcomes.},

We continue to improve the Pfam website and add new visualizations, such as the 'sunburst' representation of taxonomic distribution of families. In this work we additionally address two topics that will be of particular interest to the Pfam community.

abstract = {Atg8 is a ubiquitin-like protein required for autophagy in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A ubiquitin-like system mediates the conjugation of the C terminus of Atg8 to the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and this conjugate (Atg8-PE) plays a crucial role in autophagosome formation at the phagophore assembly site/pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS). The cysteine protease Atg4 processes the C terminus of newly synthesized Atg8 and also delipidates Atg8 to release the protein from membranes. While the former is a prerequisite for lipidation of Atg8, the significance of the latter in autophagy has remained unclear. Here, we show that autophagosome formation is significantly retarded in cells deficient for Atg4-mediated delipidation of Atg8. We find that Atg8-PE accumulates on various organelle membranes including the vacuole, the endosome and the ER in these cells, which depletes unlipidated Atg8 and thereby attenuates its localization to the PAS. Our results suggest that the Atg8-PE that accumulates on organelle membranes is erroneously produced by lipidation system components independently of the normal autophagic process. It is also suggested that delipidation of Atg8 by Atg4 on different organelle membranes promotes autophagosome formation. Considered together with other results, we propose that Atg4 acts to compensate for the intrinsic defect in the lipidation system; it recycles Atg8-PE generated on inappropriate membranes to maintain a reservoir of unlipidated Atg8 that is required for autophagosome formation at the PAS.},

There are many available protocols to validate the results of this genome-wide method, but they mostly share the limitation of measuring methylation at a small number of CpG positions in small numbers of samples. We developed a multiplexed DNA methylation analysis protocol, which allows for the simultaneous quantitative measurement of cytosine methylation at single nucleotide resolution in 48 PCR amplicons and 48 samples utilizing the microfluidic system established by Fluidigm. Following bisulfite conversion of 500 ng of the target DNA, a PCR reaction is performed using a 48.48 Access Array, which allows parallel amplification of 48 samples by 48 primer pairs. The products of each reaction are labeled with individual, sample specific tags, pooled in a single library and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq sequencer. The advantages of this system are: speed, small amount of input material, single nucleotide resolution, high coverage of each locus, low cost of simultaneously assaying multiple CpG loci in multiple DNA samples and high reproducibility.},

abstract = {The CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)/Cas (CRISPR-associated) system has emerged as a powerful tool for targeted gene editing in many organisms, including plants. However, all of the reported studies in plants focused on either transient systems or the first generation after the CRISPR/Cas system was stably transformed into plants. In this study we examined several plant generations with seven genes at 12 different target sites to determine the patterns, efficiency, specificity, and heritability of CRISPR/Cas-induced gene mutations or corrections in Arabidopsis. The proportion of plants bearing any mutations (chimeric, heterozygous, biallelic, or homozygous) was 71.2{\%} at T1, 58.3{\%} at T2, and 79.4{\%} at T3 generations. CRISPR/Cas-induced mutations were predominantly 1 bp insertion and short deletions. Gene modifications detected in T1 plants occurred mostly in somatic cells, and consequently there were no T1 plants that were homozygous for a gene modification event. In contrast, ∼22{\%} of T2 plants were found to be homozygous for a modified gene. All homozygotes were stable to the next generation, without any new modifications at the target sites. There was no indication of any off-target mutations by examining the target sites and sequences highly homologous to the target sites and by in-depth whole-genome sequencing. Together our results show that the CRISPR/Cas system is a useful tool for generating versatile and heritable modifications specifically at target genes in plants.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The identification and characterisation of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between phenotypes in the human genome is of prime interest in epigenetics. We present a novel method, DMRcate, that fits replicated methylation measurements from the Illumina HM450K BeadChip (or 450K array) spatially across the genome using a Gaussian kernel. DMRcate identifies and ranks the most differentially methylated regions across the genome based on tunable kernel smoothing of the differential methylation (DM) signal. The method is agnostic to both genomic annotation and local change in the direction of the DM signal, removes the bias incurred from irregularly spaced methylation sites, and assigns significance to each DMR called via comparison to a null model.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We show that, for both simulated and real data, the predictive performance of DMRcate is superior to those of Bumphunter and Probe Lasso, and commensurate with that of comb-p. For the real data, we validate all array-derived DMRs from the candidate methods on a suite of DMRs derived from whole-genome bisulfite sequencing called from the same DNA samples, using two separate phenotype comparisons.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The agglomeration of genomically localised individual methylation sites into discrete DMRs is currently best served by a combination of DM-signal smoothing and subsequent threshold specification. The findings also suggest the design of the 450K array shows preference for CpG sites that are more likely to be differentially methylated, but its overall coverage does not adequately reflect the depth and complexity of methylation signatures afforded by sequencing. For the convenience of the research community we have created a user-friendly R software package called DMRcate, downloadable from Bioconductor and compatible with existing preprocessing packages, which allows others to apply the same DMR-finding method on 450K array data.},

We use the data from the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort and observe that the risks of major chronic diseases increased exponentially and double every eight years, i.e., at a rate compatible with the Gompertz mortality law. Assuming that aging drives the acceleration in morbidity rates, we build a risk model to predict the age at the end of healthspan depending on age, gender, and genetic background. Using the sub-population of 300,447 British individuals as a discovery cohort, we identify 12 loci associated with healthspan at the whole-genome significance level. We find strong genetic correlations between healthspan and all-cause mortality, life-history, and lifestyle traits. We thereby conclude that the healthspan offers a promising new way to interrogate the genetics of human longevity.},

abstract = {The cell cycle is regulated by various protein kinases, including cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). D-type CDKs, CDK4, and CDK6, phosphorylate retinoblastoma protein and are believed to regulate through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. CDK inhibitor p16 INK4A has been characterized as binding CDK4 and CDK6 and as inhibiting phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein by these CDKs. Thus p16 INK4A is implicated in regulating the cell cycle at the G1 phase. The largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (pol II) contains an essential C-terminal domain (CTD). General transcription factor TFIIH, which contains CDK7, phosphorylates the CTD in vitro. The CTD phosphorylation is shown to be involved in transcriptional regulation in vivo and in vitro. Phosphorylation of RNA pol II CTD by TFIIH is thought to play an important role in transcriptional regulation. Here we report that p16 INK4A associates with RNA pol II CTD and TFIIH. p16 INK4A inhibited the CTD phosphorylation by TFIIH. These findings suggest that p16 INK4A may regulate transcription via CTD phosphorylation in the cell cycle.},

Gene set and cell-specific analyses show that expression in foetal brain cells and adult dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is enriched for lifespan variation, as are gene pathways involving lipid proteins and homeostasis, vesicle-mediated transport, and synaptic function. Individual genetic variants that increase dementia, cardiovascular disease, and lung cancer - but not other cancers - explain the most variance. Resulting polygenic scores show a mean lifespan difference of around five years of life across the deciles.

abstract = {In a chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiment, an important consideration in experimental design is the minimum number of sequenced reads required to obtain statistically significant results. We present an extensive evaluation of the impact of sequencing depth on identification of enriched regions for key histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K36me3, H3K27me3 and H3K9me2/me3) using deep-sequenced datasets in human and fly. We propose to define sufficient sequencing depth as the number of reads at which detected enrichment regions increase {\textless}1{\%} for an additional million reads. Although the required depth depends on the nature of the mark and the state of the cell in each experiment, we observe that sufficient depth is often reached at {\textless}20 million reads for fly. For human, there are no clear saturation points for the examined datasets, but our analysis suggests 40-50 million reads as a practical minimum for most marks. We also devise a mathematical model to estimate the sufficient depth and total genomic coverage of a mark. Lastly, we find that the five algorithms tested do not agree well for broad enrichment profiles, especially at lower depths. Our findings suggest that sufficient sequencing depth and an appropriate peak-calling algorithm are essential for ensuring robustness of conclusions derived from ChIP-seq data. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s) 2014.},

abstract = {Autophagy has been implicated in a number of physiological processes important for human heath and disease. Autophagy involves the formation of a double-membrane cytosolic vesicle, an autophagosome. Central to the formation of the autophagosome is the ubiquitin-like protein autophagy-related (Atg)8 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3/LC3 in mammalian cells). Following autophagy induction, Atg8 shows the greatest change in expression of any of the proteins required for autophagy. The magnitude of autophagy is, in part, controlled by the amount of Atg8; thus, controlling Atg8 protein levels is one potential mechanism for modulating autophagy activity. We have identified a negative regulator of ATG8 transcription, Ume6, which acts along with a histone deacetylase complex including Sin3 and Rpd3 to regulate Atg8 levels; deletion of any of these components leads to an increase in Atg8 and a concomitant increase in autophagic activity. A similar regulatory mechanism is present in mammalian cells, indicating that this process is highly conserved.},

Before iPS cell-based clinical applications can be initiated, detailed evaluations of the cells, including their differentiation potentials and tumorigenic activities in different contexts, should be investigated to establish their safety and effectiveness for cell transplantation therapies. Here we show the directed neural differentiation of murine iPS cells and examine their therapeutic potential in a mouse spinal cord injury (SCI) model. "Safe" iPS-derived neurospheres, which had been pre-evaluated as nontumorigenic by their transplantation into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mouse brain, produced electrophysiologically functional neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in vitro. Furthermore, when the safe iPS-derived neurospheres were transplanted into the spinal cord 9 d after contusive injury, they differentiated into all three neural lineages without forming teratomas or other tumors. They also participated in remyelination and induced the axonal regrowth of host 5HT(+) serotonergic fibers, promoting locomotor function recovery. However, the transplantation of iPS-derived neurospheres pre-evaluated as "unsafe" showed robust teratoma formation and sudden locomotor functional loss after functional recovery in the SCI model. These findings suggest that pre-evaluated safe iPS clone-derived neural stem/progenitor cells may be a promising cell source for transplantation therapy for SCI.},

abstract = {Early electron microscopy and more recent studies in our laboratory of Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus cells indicated the presence of narrow fibers at the nonflagellar pole of this unusual predatory bacterium. Analysis of the B. bacteriovorus HD100 genome showed a complete set of genes potentially encoding type IV pili and an incomplete gene set for Flp pili; therefore, the role of type IV pili in the predatory life cycle of B. bacteriovorus HD100 was investigated. Alignment of the predicted PilA protein with known type IV pilins showed the characteristic conserved N terminus common to type IVa pilins. The pilA gene, encoding the type IV pilus fiber protein, was insertionally inactivated in multiple Bdellovibrio replicate cultures, and the effect upon the expression of other pilus genes was monitored by reverse transcriptase PCR. Interruption of pilA in replicate isolates abolished Bdellovibrio predatory capability in liquid prey cultures and on immobilized yellow fluorescent protein-labeled prey, but the mutants could be cultured prey independently. Expression patterns of pil genes involved in the formation of type IV pili were profiled across the predatory life cycle from attack phase predatory Bdellovibrio throughout the intraperiplasmic bdelloplast stages to prey lysis and in prey-independent growth. Taken together, the data show that type IV pili play a critical role in Bdellovibrio predation.},

There is growing evidence that the ageing of the immune system is initiated at the very top of the haematopoietic hierarchy and that the ageing of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) directly contributes to changes in the immune system, referred to as immunosenescence. In this Review, we summarize the phenotypes of ageing HSCs and discuss how the cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic mechanisms of HSC ageing might promote immunosenescence. Stem cell ageing has long been considered to be irreversible. However, recent findings indicate that several molecular pathways could be targeted to rejuvenate HSCs and thus to reverse some aspects of immunosenescence.},

abstract = {Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are evolutionarily conserved chromatin modifiers and act together in three multimeric complexes, Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and Pleiohomeotic repressive complex (PhoRC), to repress transcription of the target genes. Here, we identified Polycomb target genes in Bombyx mori with holocentric centromere using genome-wide expression screening based on the knockdown of BmSCE, BmESC, BmPHO, or BmSCM gene, which represent the distinct complexes. As a result, the expressions of 29 genes were up-regulated after knocking down 4 PcG genes. Particularly, there is a significant overlap between targets of BmPho (331 out of 524) and BmScm (331 out of 532), and among these, 190 genes function as regulator factors playing important roles in development. We also found that BmPho, as well as BmScm, can interact with other Polycomb components examined in this study. Further detailed analysis revealed that the C-terminus of BmPho containing zinc finger domain is involved in the interaction between BmPho and BmScm. Moreover, the zinc finger domain in BmPho contributes to its inhibitory function and ectopic overexpression of BmScm is able to promote transcriptional repression by Gal4-Pho fusions including BmScm-interacting domain. Loss of BmPho expression causes relocalization of BmScm into the cytoplasm. Collectively, we provide evidence of a functional link between BmPho and BmScm, and propose two Polycomb-related repression mechanisms requiring only BmPho associated with BmScm or a whole set of PcG complexes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Li et al.},

We examined the associations of self-reported smoking indicators, serum cotinine levels and smoking-related DNA methylation biomarkers with a quantitative frailty index (FI) in 2 independent subsets of older adults (age 50-75) recruited in Saarland, Germany in 2000 - 2002 (discovery set: n = 978, validation set: n = 531). We obtained DNA methylation profiles in whole blood samples by Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip and calculated the FI according to the method of Mitnitski and Rockwood. Mixed linear regression models were implemented to assess the associations between smoking indicators and the FI. After controlling for potential covariates, current smoking, cumulative smoking exposure (pack-years), and time after smoking cessation (years) were significantly associated with the FI (P-value {\textless} 0.05). In the discovery panel, 17 out of 151 previously identified smoking-related CpG sites were associated with the FI after correction for multiple testing (FDR {\textless} 0.05). Nine of them survived in the validation phase and were designated as frailty-associated loci. A smoking index (SI) based on the 9 loci manifested a monotonic association with the FI. In conclusion, this study suggested that epigenetic alterations could play a role in smoking-associated development of frailty. The identified CpG sites have the potential to be prognostic biomarkers of frailty and frailty-related health outcomes. Our findings and the underlying mechanisms should be followed up in further, preferably longitudinal studies.},

abstract = {The relationship between evolutionary genome remodeling and the three-dimensional structure of the genome remain largely unexplored. Here we use the heavily rearranged gibbon genome to examine how evolutionary chromosomal rearrangements impact genome-wide chromatin interactions, topologically associating domains (TADs), and their epigenetic landscape. We use high-resolution maps of gibbon-human breaks of synteny (BOS), apply Hi-C in gibbon, measure an array of epigenetic features, and perform cross-species comparisons. We find that gibbon rearrangements occur at TAD boundaries, independent of the parameters used to identify TADs. This overlap is supported by a remarkable genetic and epigenetic similarity between BOS and TAD boundaries, namely presence of CpG islands and SINE elements, and enrichment in CTCF and H3K4me3 binding. Cross-species comparisons reveal that regions orthologous to BOS also correspond with boundaries of large (400-600kb) TADs in human and other mammalian species. The co-localization of rearrangement breakpoints and TAD boundaries may be due to higher chromatin fragility at these locations and/or increased selective pressure against rearrangements that disrupt TAD integrity. We also examine the small portion of BOS that did not overlap with TAD boundaries and gave rise to novel TADs in the gibbon genome. We postulate that these new TADs generally lack deleterious consequences. Lastly, we show that limited epigenetic homogenization occurs across breakpoints, irrespective of their time of occurrence in the gibbon lineage. Overall, our findings demonstrate remarkable conservation of chromatin interactions and epigenetic landscape in gibbons, in spite of extensive genomic shuffling.},

In murine models of accelerated aging, genetic deficiency and targeted inhibition of PAI-1 protect against aging-like pathology and prolong life span. However, the role of PAI-1 in human longevity remains unclear. We hypothesized that a rare loss-of-function mutation in SERPINE1 (c.699{\_}700dupTA), which encodes PAI-1, could play a role in longevity and metabolism in humans. We studied 177 members of the Berne Amish community, which included 43 carriers of the null SERPINE1 mutation. Heterozygosity was associated with significantly longer leukocyte telomere length, lower fasting insulin levels, and lower prevalence of diabetes mellitus. In the extended Amish kindred, carriers of the null SERPINE1 allele had a longer life span. Our study indicates a causal effect of PAI-1 on human longevity, which may be mediated by alterations in metabolism. Our findings demonstrate the utility of studying loss-of-function mutations in populations with geographic and genetic isolation and shed light on a novel therapeutic target for aging.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED Sodium bisulfite conversion followed by sequencing (BS-Seq, such as whole genome bisulfite sequencing or reduced representation bisulfite sequencing) has become popular for studying human epigenetic profiles. Identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is important for quantification of methylation levels and for study of allele-specific epigenetic events such as imprinting. However, SNP calling in such data is complex and time consuming. Here, we present an ultrafast and memory-efficient package named BS-SNPer for the exploration of SNP sites from BS-Seq data. Compared with Bis-SNP, a popular BS-Seq specific SNP caller, BS-SNPer is over 100 times faster and uses less memory. BS-SNPer also offers higher sensitivity and specificity compared with existing methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION BS-SNPer is written in C++ and Perl, and is freely available at https://github.com/hellbelly/BS-Snper.},

abstract = {Hypermethylation of CpG islands, resulting in the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, is an early event in the development of some malignancies. Recent studies suggest that this abnormal methylation may be a function of aging. The number of CpG islands that methylate with age is unknown. We used restriction landmark genome scanning (RLGS) to approximate the extent to which CpG islands change methylation status during aging. Comparison of more than 2000 loci in T lymphocytes isolated from newborn, middle age, and elderly people revealed that 29 loci (???1{\%}) changed methylation status during aging, with 23 increasing methylation, and six decreasing. The same subset also changed methylation status with age in the esophagus, lung, and pancreas, but in variable directions. Virtual genome scanning identified one of these loci as a member of the forkhead family, recently implicated in aging, and another as an EST fragment. The methylation status of both correlated with level of expression. Confirming studies in multiple tissues from normal and DNMT1+/- mice demonstrated only one age dependent change in the methylation of more than 2000 loci, occurring in liver and kidney. These results indicate that the methylation status of the majority of CpG islands in both mice and humans is tightly controlled during aging, and that changes are infrequent and in humans confined to a specific subset of genes. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Recent studies have unequivocally associated the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene with the risk of obesity. In vitro FTO protein is an AlkB-like DNA/RNA demethylase with a strong preference for 3-methylthymidine (3-meT) in single-stranded DNA or 3-methyluracil (3-meU) in single-stranded RNA. Here we report the crystal structure of FTO in complex with the mononucleotide 3-meT. FTO comprises an amino-terminal AlkB-like domain and a carboxy-terminal domain with a novel fold. Biochemical assays show that these two domains interact with each other, which is required for FTO catalytic activity. In contrast with the structures of other AlkB members, FTO possesses an extra loop covering one side of the conserved jelly-roll motif. Structural comparison shows that this loop selectively competes with the unmethylated strand of the DNA duplex for binding to FTO, suggesting that it has an important role in FTO selection against double-stranded nucleic acids. The ability of FTO to distinguish 3-meT or 3-meU from other nucleotides is conferred by its hydrogen-bonding interaction with the two carbonyl oxygen atoms in 3-meT or 3-meU. Taken together, these results provide a structural basis for understanding FTO substrate-specificity, and serve as a foundation for the rational design of FTO inhibitors.},

abstract = {The involvement of transcription factors Arabidopsis abscisic acid-insensitive3 (ABI3), maize viviparous1 (VP1) and Phaseolus vulgaris ABI3-like factor (PvALF) in the spatial control of storage protein gene expression is well established. However, little insight exists as to how they are themselves regulated. To address this, a 5.15 kb ABI3 upstream sequence including a 4.6 kb full-length promoter and 519 bp of 5'-untranslated region (UTR) was used to drive either beta-glucuronidase (GUS) or green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in Arabidopsis. Expression from the full-length (- 4630/ + 519ABI3 ) and various 5'-truncated promoters was detected during embryogenesis in all lines, except those transgenic for promoter elements shorter than 364 bp. Two upstream activating regions, -3600 to -2033 and -2033 to -882, enhanced GUS expression in seeds. The -882 to -364 region was sufficient to confer seed-specific expression of GUS when fused to a - 64/ + 6CaMV 35S minimal promoter. Expression from the ABI3 promoter constructs was seed-specific, except in the presence of exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) ({\textgreater}0.3 microM), when GUS expression was detected in seedling roots. Excision of a 405 bp region containing three upstream open reading frames (uORFs) from the 5'-UTR dramatically increased GUS expression and debilitated constraint of reporter expression in roots. Negative regulation of ABI3 expression by the 5'-UTR may involve a post-transcriptional mechanism analogous to that of tumor suppressor genes which also bear long, uORF-containing, 5'-UTRs, or through interactions with RNA-binding proteins.},

abstract = {Mutation of the retinoblastoma tumour-suppressor gene (RB) leads to the deregulation of many proteins and transcription factors that interact with the retinoblastoma gene product (pRB), including members of the E2F transcription factor family. As pRB is known to repress E2F transcriptional activity and overexpression of E2F is sufficient for cell cycle progression, it is thought that pRB suppresses growth in part by repressing E2F-mediated transcription. Previously, we reported that loss of E2f1 in mice results in tissue-specific tumour induction and tissue atrophy, demonstrating that E2F-1 normally controls growth both positively and negatively in a tissue-specific fashion. To determine whether E2F-1 deregulation--as a result of loss of pRB--promotes proliferation in vivo, we have tested whether loss of E2f1 interferes with the pituitary and thyroid tumorigenesis that occurs in Rb1(+/-) mice. We have found that loss of E2f1 reduces the frequency of pituitary and thyroid tumours, and greatly lengthens the lifespan of Rb1(+/-); E2f1(-/-) animals, demonstrating that E2F-1 is an important downstream target of pRB during tumorigenesis. Furthermore, loss of E2f1 reduces a previously reported strain-dependent difference in Rb1(+/-) lifespan, suggesting that E2f1 or an E2F-1-regulated gene acts as a genetic modifier between the 129/Sv and C57BL/6 strains.},

Here, we aimed to investigate how mitochondria respond to acute DNA damage with respect to mitophagy, which is an important mitochondrial quality control process. Our results show that mitophagy increases after DNA damage in primary fibroblasts, murine neurons and Caenorhabditis elegans neurons. Our results indicate that modulation of mitophagy after DNA damage is independent of the type of DNA damage stimuli used and that the protein Spata18 is an important player in this process. Knockdown of Spata18 suppresses mitophagy, disturbs mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis, affects ATP production, and attenuates DNA repair. Importantly, mitophagy after DNA damage is a vital cellular response to maintain mitochondrial functions and DNA repair.},

abstract = {For the past 25 years, it has been known that alterations in DNA methylation (DNAm) occur in cancer, including hypomethylation of oncogenes and hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes. However, most studies of cancer methylation have assumed that functionally important DNAm will occur in promoters, and that most DNAm changes in cancer occur in CpG islands. Here we show that most methylation alterations in colon cancer occur not in promoters, and also not in CpG islands, but in sequences up to 2 kb distant, which we term 'CpG island shores'. CpG island shore methylation was strongly related to gene expression, and it was highly conserved in mouse, discriminating tissue types regardless of species of origin. There was a notable overlap (45-65{\%}) of the locations of colon cancer-related methylation changes with those that distinguished normal tissues, with hypermethylation enriched closer to the associated CpG islands, and hypomethylation enriched further from the associated CpG island and resembling that of noncolon normal tissues. Thus, methylation changes in cancer are at sites that vary normally in tissue differentiation, consistent with the epigenetic progenitor model of cancer, which proposes that epigenetic alterations affecting tissue-specific differentiation are the predominant mechanism by which epigenetic changes cause cancer.},

abstract = {Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that cluster in the first intron of fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene are associated obesity traits in genome-wide association studies. The minor allele increases BMI by 0.39 kg/m(2) (or 1,130 g in body weight) and risk of obesity by 1.20-fold. This association has been confirmed across age groups and populations of diverse ancestry; the largest effect is seen in young adulthood. The effect of FTO SNPs on obesity traits in populations of African and Asian ancestry is similar or somewhat smaller than in European ancestry populations. However, the BMI-increasing allele in FTO is substantially less prevalent in populations with non-European ancestry. FTO SNPs do not influence physical activity levels; yet, in physically active individuals, FTO's effect on obesity susceptibility is attenuated by approximately 30{\%}. Evidence from epidemiological and functional studies suggests that FTO confers an increased risk of obesity by subtly changing food intake and preference. Moreover, emerging data suggest a role for FTO in nutrient sensing, regulation of mRNA translation and general growth. In this Review, we discuss the genetic epidemiology of FTO and discuss how its complex biology might link to the regulation of body weight.},

Monitoring m6A levels upon WTAP depletion allowed the definition of accurate and near single-nucleotide resolution methylation maps and their classification into WTAP-dependent and -independent sites. WTAP-dependent sites are located at internal positions in transcripts, topologically static across a variety of systems we surveyed, and inversely correlated with mRNA stability, consistent with a role in establishing "basal" degradation rates. WTAP-independent sites form at the first transcribed base as part of the cap structure and are present at thousands of sites, forming a previously unappreciated layer of transcriptome complexity.

This article reviews recent studies that have challenged the traditional model of vitamin D mediated transcellular calcium absorption and the crucial role of specific calcium transport proteins in intestinal calcium absorption. There is also increasing evidence that 1,25(OH)2D3 can enhance paracellular calcium diffusion.

In this report we describe a gene expression system to characterize proteins of unknown function from the obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis. We have devised a homologous recombination-based cloning strategy to construct an ordered array of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains expressing all Chlamydia-specific genes. These strains were screened to identify chlamydial proteins that impaired various yeast cellular functions or that displayed tropism towards eukaryotic organelles. In addition, to identify bacterial factors that are secreted into the host cell, recombinant chlamydial proteins were screened for reactivity towards antisera raised against vacuolar membranes purified from infected mammalian cells. We report the identification of 34 C. trachomatis proteins that impact yeast cellular functions or are tropic for a range of eukaryotic organelles including mitochondria, nucleus and cytoplasmic lipid droplets, and a new family of Chlamydia-specific proteins that are exported from the parasitopherous vacuole. The versatility of molecular manipulations and protein expression in yeast allows for the rapid construction of comprehensive protein expression arrays to explore the function of pathogen-specific gene products from microorganisms that are difficult to genetically manipulate, grow in culture or too dangerous for routine analysis in the laboratory.},

The 2.7 A resolution structure of the Thermus thermophilus RNA polymerase (RNAP) holoenzyme in complex with ppGpp reveals that ppGpp binds to the same site near the active center in both independent RNAP molecules in the crystal but in strikingly distinct orientations. Binding is symmetrical with respect to the two diphosphates of ppGpp and is relaxed with respect to the orientation of the nucleotide base. Different modes of ppGpp binding are coupled with asymmetry of the active site configurations.

abstract = {Aging is associated with an increased risk of cancer, possibly in part because of an age-related increase in mutations in normal tissues. Due to their extremely low abundance, somatic mutations in normal tissues frequently escape detection. Tumors, as clonal expansions of single cells, can provide information about the somatic mutations present in these cells prior to tumorigenesis. Here, we used data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), to systematically study the frequency and spectrum of somatic mutations in a total of 6,969 patients and 34 different tumor types as a function of the age of the patient. After using linear modeling to control for the age structure of different tumor types, we found that the number of identified somatic mutations increases exponentially with age. Using additional data from the literature, we found that accumulation of somatic mutations is associated with cell division rate, cancer risk and cigarette smoking, with the latter also associated with a distinct spectrum of mutations. Our results confirm that aging is associated with the accumulation of somatic mutations, and strongly suggest that the level of genome instability of normal cells, modified by both endogenous and environmental factors, is the main risk factor for cancer.},

A major determinant of the second sort of bias is tRNA content, codons recognized by abundant tRNAs being used more often than those recognised by rare tRNAs, particularly in highly expressed genes, probably owing to selection at the level of translation against codons recognized by rare tRNAs1-3. Conversely, codon usage is likely to exert selection pressure on tRNA abundance4. Here I develop a model for the coevolution of codon usage and tRNA abundance which explains why there are unequal abundances of synonymous tRNAs leading to biased usage between groups of codons recognized by them in unicellular organisms. {\textcopyright} 1987 Nature Publishing Group.},

However there is wide variation in blood processing and methods for isolation of circulating free DNA (cfDNA) and microRNAs (miRNAs). Here we compare the extraction efficiency and reproducibility of 4 commercially available kits for cfDNA and 3 for miRNA using spike-in of reference templates. We also compare the effects of increasing time between venepuncture and centrifugation and differential centrifugation force on recovery of CNAs. cfDNA was quantified by TaqMan qPCR and targeted deep sequencing. miRNA profiles were assessed with TaqMan low-density arrays and assays. The QIAamp({\textregistered}) DNA Blood Mini and Circulating nucleic acid kits gave the highest recovery of cfDNA and efficient recovery ({\textgreater}90{\%}) of a 564bp spike-in. Moreover, targeted sequencing revealed overlapping cfDNA profiles and variant depth, including detection of HER2 gene amplification, using the Ion AmpliSeq™Cancer Hotspot Panel v2. Highest yields of miRNA and the synthetic Arabidopsis thaliana miR-159a spike-in were obtained using the miRNeasy Serum/Plasma kit, with saturation above 200 µl of plasma. miRNA profiles showed significant variation with increasing time before centrifugation (p{\textless}0.001) and increasing centrifugation force, with depletion of platelet associated miRNAs, whereas cfDNA was unaffected. However, sample replicates showed excellent reproducibility on TaqMan low density arrays ($\rho$ = 0.96, p{\textless}0.0001). We also successfully generated miRNA profiles for plasma samples stored {\textgreater} 12 years, highlighting the potential for analysis of stored sample biobanks.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Small RNAs complex with proteins to mediate a variety of functions in animals and plants. Some small RNAs, particularly miRNAs, circulate in mammalian blood and may carry out a signaling function by entering target cells and modulating gene expression. The subject of this study is a set of circulating 30-33 nt RNAs that are processed derivatives of the 5' ends of a small subset of tRNA genes, and closely resemble cellular tRNA derivatives (tRFs, tiRNAs, half-tRNAs, 5' tRNA halves) previously shown to inhibit translation initiation in response to stress in cultured cells. RESULTS In sequencing small RNAs extracted from mouse serum, we identified abundant 5' tRNA halves derived from a small subset of tRNAs, implying that they are produced by tRNA type-specific biogenesis and/or release. The 5' tRNA halves are not in exosomes or microvesicles, but circulate as particles of 100-300 kDa. The size of these particles suggest that the 5' tRNA halves are a component of a macromolecular complex; this is supported by the loss of 5' tRNA halves from serum or plasma treated with EDTA, a chelating agent, but their retention in plasma anticoagulated with heparin or citrate. A survey of somatic tissues reveals that 5' tRNA halves are concentrated within blood cells and hematopoietic tissues, but scant in other tissues, suggesting that they may be produced by blood cells. Serum levels of specific subtypes of 5' tRNA halves change markedly with age, either up or down, and these changes can be prevented by calorie restriction. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate that 5' tRNA halves circulate in the blood in a stable form, most likely as part of a nucleoprotein complex, and their serum levels are subject to regulation by age and calorie restriction. They may be produced by blood cells, but their cellular targets are not yet known. The characteristics of these circulating molecules, and their known function in suppression of translation initiation, suggest that they are a novel form of signaling molecule.},

abstract = {Transposon reactivation is an inherent danger in cells that lose epigenetic silencing during developmental reprogramming. In the mouse, long terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposons, or endogenous retroviruses (ERV), account for most novel insertions and are expressed in the absence of histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation in preimplantation stem cells. We found abundant 18 nt tRNA-derived small RNA (tRF) in these cells and ubiquitously expressed 22 nt tRFs that include the 3′ terminal CCA of mature tRNAs and target the tRNA primer binding site (PBS) essential for ERV reverse transcription. We show that the two most active ERV families, IAP and MusD/ETn, are major targets and are strongly inhibited by tRFs in retrotransposition assays. 22 nt tRFs post-transcriptionally silence coding-competent ERVs, while 18 nt tRFs specifically interfere with reverse transcription and retrotransposon mobility. The PBS offers a unique target to specifically inhibit LTR-retrotransposons, and tRF-targeting is a potentially highly conserved mechanism of small RNA–mediated transposon control.},

@article{Liang2014,
abstract = {Recent deep sequencing studies have revealed thousands of circular noncoding RNAs generated from protein-coding genes. These RNAs are produced when the precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing machinery "backsplices" and covalently joins, for example, the two ends of a single exon. However, the mechanism by which the spliceosome selects only certain exons to circularize is largely unknown. Using extensive mutagenesis of expression plasmids, we show that miniature introns containing the splice sites along with short (∼ 30- to 40-nucleotide) inverted repeats, such as Alu elements, are sufficient to allow the intervening exons to circularize in cells. The intronic repeats must base-pair to one another, thereby bringing the splice sites into close proximity to each other. More than simple thermodynamics is clearly at play, however, as not all repeats support circularization, and increasing the stability of the hairpin between the repeats can sometimes inhibit circular RNA biogenesis. The intronic repeats and exonic sequences must collaborate with one another, and a functional 3' end processing signal is required, suggesting that circularization may occur post-transcriptionally. These results suggest detailed and generalizable models that explain how the splicing machinery determines whether to produce a circular noncoding RNA or a linear mRNA.},

The antibody quantitatively precipitates snRNPs U2 and U4/U6 from total nucleoplasmic snRNPs U1-U6 isolated from HeLa cells, which demonstrates that the m6A residues of the respective snRNAs are not protected by snRNP proteins in the snRNP particles. While the anti-m6A IgG does not react at all with U5 RNPs lacking m6A, a significant amount of U1 RNPs was co-precipitated despite the fact that U1 RNA does not contain m6A either. Since anti-m6A IgG does not react with purified U1 RNPs and co-precipitation of U1 RNPs is dependent on the presence of U2 RNPs but not of U4/U6 RNPs, these data indicate an interaction between snRNPs U1 and U2 in vitro. The anti-m6A precipitation pattern described above was also observed with snRNPs isolation from mouse Ehrlich ascites tumor cells, indicating similar three-dimensional arrangements of snRNAs in homologous snRNP particles from different organisms.},

abstract = {Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcriptional protein family members, including FOXO1 and FOXO3, are involved in the modulation of autophagy. However, whether there is redundancy between FOXO1 and FOXO3 in the ability to induce autophagy remains unclear. In this study, we showed that FOXO3 induced a transcription-dependent autophagy, and FOXO1 was required for this process. Overexpression of wild-type FOXO3 (WT) or FOXO3 (3A), which harbors alanine mutations at residues Thr32, Ser253 and Ser315, but not transcription-inactive FOXO3 (∆DB3A), significantly induced autophagy in the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T and mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines. Interestingly, depletion of FOXO1 by siRNA attenuated FOXO3-induced autophagy. Our data also showed that FOXO3 overexpression did not increase the expression of FOXO1 at the protein level, although FOXO3 was capable of binding the promoter region of FOXO1 and inducing an increase in the transcription of FOXO1 mRNA. Furthermore, our results showed that FOXO3 promoted the translocation of FOXO1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, resulting in an increase in FOXO1-induced autophagy. Moreover, our results supported a mechanism whereby FOXO3 dramatically increased the expression of the class I PtdIns3K catalytic subunit PIK3CA, leading to an increase in AKT1 activity, which resulted in the phosphorylation and nuclear export of FOXO1. To the best of our knowledge, our data are the first to suggest that FOXO1 plays a central role in FOXO3-induced autophagy.},

abstract = {The Human Ageing Genomic Resources (HAGR, http://genomics.senescence.info) is a freely available online collection of research databases and tools for the biology and genetics of ageing. HAGR features now several databases with high-quality manually curated data: (i) GenAge, a database of genes associated with ageing in humans and model organisms; (ii) AnAge, an extensive collection of longevity records and complementary traits for {\textgreater}4000 vertebrate species; and (iii) GenDR, a newly incorporated database, containing both gene mutations that interfere with dietary restriction-mediated lifespan extension and consistent gene expression changes induced by dietary restriction. Since its creation about 10 years ago, major efforts have been undertaken to maintain the quality of data in HAGR, while further continuing to develop, improve and extend it. This article briefly describes the content of HAGR and details the major updates since its previous publications, in terms of both structure and content. The completely redesigned interface, more intuitive and more integrative of HAGR resources, is also presented. Altogether, we hope that through its improvements, the current version of HAGR will continue to provide users with the most comprehensive and accessible resources available today in the field of biogerontology.},

abstract = {Lipid droplets (LDs) are ubiquitous but poorly understood neutral-lipid-rich eukaryotic organelles that may participate in functions as diverse as lipid homeostasis, membrane traffic, and signaling . We report that infection with the obligate intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis, the causative agent of trachoma and many sexually transmitted diseases , leads to the accumulation of neutral-lipid-rich structures with features of LDs at the cytoplasmic surface of the bacteria-containing vacuole. To identify bacterial factors that target these organelles, we screened a collection of yeast strains expressing GFP-tagged chlamydial ORFs and identified several proteins with tropism for eukaryotic LDs. We determined that three of these LD-associated (Lda) proteins are translocated into the mammalian host and associate with neutral-lipid-rich structures. Furthermore, the stability of one Lda protein is dependent on binding to LDs, and pharmacological inhibition of LD formation negatively impacted chlamydial replication. These results suggest that C. trachomatis targets LDs to enhance its survival and replication in infected cells. The co-option of mammalian LD function by a pathogenic bacterium represents a novel mechanism of eukaryotic organelle subversion and provides unique research opportunities to explore the function of these understudied organelles.},

abstract = {Transfer RNA (tRNA) genes are among the most highly transcribed genes in the genome owing to their central role in protein synthesis. However, there is evidence for a broad range of gene expression across tRNA loci. This complexity, combined with difficulty in measuring transcript abundance and high sequence identity across transcripts, has severely limited our collective understanding of tRNA gene expression regulation and evolution. We establish sequence-based correlates to tRNA gene expression and develop a tRNA gene classification method that does not require, but benefits from, comparative genomic information and achieves accuracy comparable to molecular assays. We observe that guanine + cytosine (G + C) content and CpG density surrounding tRNA loci is exceptionally well correlated with tRNA gene activity, supporting a prominent regulatory role of the local genomic context in combination with internal sequence features. We use our tRNA gene activity predictions in conjunction with a comprehensive tRNA gene ortholog set spanning 29 placental mammals to estimate the evolutionary rate of functional changes among orthologs. Our method adds a new dimension to large-scale tRNA functional prediction and will help prioritize characterization of functional tRNA variants. Its simplicity and robustness should enable development of similar approaches for other clades, as well as exploration of functional diversification of members of large gene families.},

To a large extent, these processes are influenced by alterations affecting the integrity of genome architecture and, ultimately, its phenotypic expression. Despite the progress made towards establishing causal links between genomic and epigenomic changes and aging, mechanisms underlying metabolic dysregulation and age-related phenotypes remain obscure. Here, we present a model linking genome-wide changes and their age-related phenotypic consequences via the alteration of macromolecular complexes and cellular networks. This approach may provide a better understanding of the dynamically changing genome–phenome map with age, but also deeper insights to developing more targeted therapies to prevent and/or manage late-onset degenerative disorders as well as decelerate aging.},

Here, we present our analyses of the Prostate Cancer (PRAD) datasets of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) from the standpoint of isomiRs and tRFs. This study represents the first simultaneous examination of isomiRs and tRFs in a large cohort of PRAD patients. We find that isomiRs and tRFs have extensive correlations with messenger RNAs (mRNAs). These correlations are disrupted in PRAD, which suggests disruptions of the regulatory network in the disease state. Notably, we find that the profiles of isomiRs and tRFs differ in patients belonging to different races. We hope that the presented findings can lay the groundwork for future research efforts aimed at elucidating the functional roles of the numerous and distinct members of these two categories of ncRNAs that are present in PRAD.},

Conventional methods of DNA methylation analysis, such as bisulfite sequencing, methylation sensitive restriction enzyme digestion and array-based detection techniques, have major limitations that impede high-throughput genome-wide analysis. We describe a novel technique, MBD-isolated Genome Sequencing (MiGS), which combines precipitation of methylated DNA by recombinant methyl-CpG binding domain of MBD2 protein and sequencing of the isolated DNA by a massively parallel sequencer. We utilized MiGS to study three isogenic cancer cell lines with varying degrees of DNA methylation. We successfully detected previously known methylated regions in these cells and identified hundreds of novel methylated regions. This technique is highly specific and sensitive and can be applied to any biological settings to identify differentially methylated regions at the genomic scale.},

abstract = {In mammals, insulin signalling regulates glucose transport together with the expression and activity of various metabolic enzymes. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a related pathway regulates metabolism, development and longevity. Wild-type animals enter the developmentally arrested dauer stage in response to high levels of a secreted pheromone, accumulating large amounts of fat in their intestines and hypodermis. Mutants in DAF-2 (a homologue of the mammalian insulin receptor) and AGE-1 (a homologue of the catalytic subunit of mammalian phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase) arrest development at the dauer stage. Moreover, animals bearing weak or temperature-sensitive mutations in daf-2 and age-1 can develop reproductively, but nevertheless show increased energy storage and longevity. Here we show that null mutations in daf-16 suppress the effects of mutations in daf-2 or age-1; lack of daf-16 bypasses the need for this insulin receptor-like signalling pathway. The principal role of DAF-2/AGE-1 signalling is thus to antagonize DAF-16. daf-16 is widely expressed and encodes three members of the Fork head family of transcription factors. The DAF-2 pathway acts synergistically with the pathway activated by a nematode TGF-beta-type signal, DAF-7, suggesting that DAF-16 cooperates with nematode SMAD proteins in regulating the transcription of key metabolic and developmental control genes. The probable human orthologues of DAF-16, FKHR and AFX, may also act downstream of insulin signalling and cooperate with TGF-beta effectors in mediating metabolic regulation. These genes may be dysregulated in diabetes.},

abstract = {Macroautophagy is a bulk degradation process induced by starvation in eukaryotic cells. In yeast, 15 Apg proteins coordinate the formation of autophagosomes. Several key reactions performed by these proteins have been described, but a comprehensive understanding of the overall network is still lacking. Based on Apg protein localization, we have identified a novel structure that functions in autophagosome formation. This pre-autophagosomal structure, containing at least five Apg proteins, i.e. Apg1p, Apg2p, Apg5p, Aut7p/Apg8p and Apg16p, is localized in the vicinity of the vacuole. Analysis of apg mutants revealed that the formation of both a phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated Aut7p and an Apg12p- Apg5p conjugate is essential for the localization of Aut7p to the pre-autophagosomal structure. Vps30p/Apg6p and Apg14p, components of an autophagy- specific phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex, Apg9p and Apg16p are all required for the localization of Apg5p and Aut7p to the structure. The Apg1p protein kinase complex functions in the late stage of autophagosome formation. Here, we present the classification of Apg proteins into three groups that reflect each step of autophagosome formation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Diverse molecular alterations associated with smoking in normal and precursor lung cancer cells have been reported, yet their role in lung cancer etiology remains unclear. A prominent example is hypomethylation of the aryl hydrocarbon-receptor repressor (AHRR) locus, which is observed in blood and squamous epithelial cells of smokers, but not in lung cancer. RESULTS Using a novel systems-epigenomics algorithm, called SEPIRA, which leverages the power of a large RNA-sequencing expression compendium to infer regulatory activity from messenger RNA expression or DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles, we infer the landscape of binding activity of lung-specific transcription factors (TFs) in lung carcinogenesis. We show that lung-specific TFs become preferentially inactivated in lung cancer and precursor lung cancer lesions and further demonstrate that these results can be derived using only DNAm data. We identify subsets of TFs which become inactivated in precursor cells. Among these regulatory factors, we identify AHR, the aryl hydrocarbon-receptor which controls a healthy immune response in the lung epithelium and whose repressor, AHRR, has recently been implicated in smoking-mediated lung cancer. In addition, we identify FOXJ1, a TF which promotes growth of airway cilia and effective clearance of the lung airway epithelium from carcinogens. CONCLUSIONS We identify TFs, such as AHR, which become inactivated in the earliest stages of lung cancer and which, unlike AHRR hypomethylation, are also inactivated in lung cancer itself. The novel systems-epigenomics algorithm SEPIRA will be useful to the wider epigenome-wide association study community as a means of inferring regulatory activity.},

abstract = {Supercentenarians, people who have reached 110 y of age, are a great model of healthy aging. Their characteristics of delayed onset of age-related diseases and compression of morbidity imply that their immune system remains functional. Here we performed single-cell transcriptome analysis of 61,202 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), derived from 7 supercentenarians and 5 younger controls. We identified a marked increase of cytotoxic CD4 T cells (CD4 cytotoxic T lymphocytes [CTLs]) as a signature of supercentenarians. Furthermore, single-cell T cell receptor sequencing of 2 supercentenarians revealed that CD4 CTLs had accumulated through massive clonal expansion, with the most frequent clonotypes accounting for 15 to 35{\%} of the entire CD4 T cell population. The CD4 CTLs exhibited substantial heterogeneity in their degree of cytotoxicity as well as a nearly identical transcriptome to that of CD8 CTLs. This indicates that CD4 CTLs utilize the transcriptional program of the CD8 lineage while retaining CD4 expression. Indeed, CD4 CTLs extracted from supercentenarians produced IFN-$\gamma$ and TNF-$\alpha$ upon ex vivo stimulation. Our study reveals that supercentenarians have unique characteristics in their circulating lymphocytes, which may represent an essential adaptation to achieve exceptional longevity by sustaining immune responses to infections and diseases.},

abstract = {Alterations in methylation are widespread in cancers. DNA methylation of promoter-associated CpG islands is an alternate mechanism to mutation in silencing gene function, and affects tumor-suppressor genes such as p16 and RBI, growth and differentiation controlling genes such as ER and many others. Evidence is now accumulating that some of these methylation changes may initiate in subpopulations of normal cells as a function of age and progressively increase during carcinogenesis. Age-related methylation appears to be widespread and is one of the earliest changes marking the risk for neoplasia. In colon cancer, we have shown a pattern of age-related methylation for several genes, including ER, IGF2, N33 and MyoD, which progresses to full methylation in adenomas and neoplasms. Hypermethylation of these genes is associated with gene silencing. Age-related methylation involves at least 50{\%} of the genes which are hypermethylated in colon cancer, and we propose that such age-related methylation may partly account for the fact that most cancers occur as a function of old age. Age-related methylation, then, may be a fundamental mark of the field defect in patients with neoplasia. The causes of age-related methylation are still unknown at this point, but evidence points to an interplay between local predisposing factors in DNA (methylation centers), levels of gene expression and environmental exposure. The concept that age-related methylation is a predisposing factor for neoplasia implies that it may serve as a diagnostic risk marker in cancer, and as a novel target for chemoprevention. Studies in animal models support this hypothesis and should lead to novel approaches to risk-assessment and chemoprevention in humans.},

abstract = {Over 450 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes have been annotated in the human genome. Reliable quantitation of tRNA levels in human samples using microarray methods presents a technical challenge. We have developed a microarray method to quantify tRNAs based on a fluorescent dye-labeling technique. The first-generation tRNA microarray consists of 42 probes for nuclear encoded tRNAs and 21 probes for mitochondrial encoded tRNAs. These probes cover tRNAs for all 20 amino acids and 11 isoacceptor families. Using this array, we report that the amounts of tRNA within the total cellular RNA vary widely among eight different human tissues. The brain expresses higher overall levels of nuclear encoded tRNAs than every tissue examined but one and higher levels of mitochondrial encoded tRNAs than every tissue examined. We found tissue-specific differences in the expression of individual tRNA species, and tRNAs decoding amino acids with similar chemical properties exhibited coordinated expression in distinct tissue types. Relative tRNA abundance exhibits a statistically significant correlation to the codon usage of a collection of highly expressed, tissue-specific genes in a subset of tissues or tRNA isoacceptors. Our findings demonstrate the existence of tissue-specific expression of tRNA species that strongly implicates a role for tRNA heterogeneity in regulating translation and possibly additional processes in vertebrate organisms.},

abstract = {DNA methylation plays an essential role in the regulation of gene expression. While its presence near the transcription start site of a gene has been associated with reduced expression, the variation in methylation levels across individuals, its environmental or genetic causes, and its association with gene expression remain poorly understood. We report the joint analysis of sequence variants, gene expression and DNA methylation in primary fibroblast samples derived from a set of 62 unrelated individuals. Approximately 2{\%} of the most variable CpG sites are mappable in cis to sequence variation, usually within 5 kb. Via eQTL analysis with microarray data combined with mapping of allelic expression regions, we obtained a set of 2,770 regions mappable in cis to sequence variation. In 9.5{\%} of these expressed regions, an associated SNP was also a methylation QTL. Methylation and gene expression are often correlated without direct discernible involvement of sequence variation, but not always in the expected direction of negative for promoter CpGs and positive for gene-body CpGs. Population-level correlation between methylation and expression is strongest in a subset of developmentally significant genes, including all four HOX clusters. The presence and sign of this correlation are best predicted using specific chromatin marks rather than position of the CpG site with respect to the gene. Our results indicate a wide variety of relationships between gene expression, DNA methylation and sequence variation in untransformed adult human fibroblasts, with considerable involvement of chromatin features and some discernible involvement of sequence variation.},

In this Review, we focus on reversible methylation through the most prevalent mammalian mRNA internal modification, N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A). Recent studies have discovered protein 'writers', 'erasers' and 'readers' of this RNA chemical mark, as well as its dynamic deposition on mRNA and other types of nuclear RNA. These findings strongly indicate dynamic regulatory roles that are analogous to the well-known reversible epigenetic modifications of DNA and histone proteins.

A large part of the chlamydial intracellular survival strategy involves the formation of a unique organelle called the inclusion that provides a protected site within which they replicate. The chlamydial inclusion is effectively isolated from endocytic pathways but is fusogenic with a subset of exocytic vesicles that deliver sphingomyelin from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. A combination of host and parasite functions contribute to the biogenesis of this compartment. Establishment of the mature inclusion is accompanied by the insertion of multiple chlamydial proteins, suggesting that chlamydiae actively modify the inclusion to define its interactions with the eukaryotic host cell. Despite being sequestered within a membrane-bound vacuole, chlamydiae clearly communicate with and manipulate the host cell from within this privileged intracellular niche.},

Mutant males also show extended life spans. age-1(hx546) is associated with a 75{\%} decrease in hermaphrodite self-fertility as compared to the age-1+ allele at 20 degrees. Using two novel strategies for following the segregation of age-1, we present evidence that longer life results from a mutation in a single gene that increases the probability of survival at all chronological ages. The long-life and reduced-fertility phenotypes cosegregate and are tightly linked to fer-15, a locus on linkage group II. age-1(hx546) does not affect the timing of larval molts, the length of embryogenesis, food uptake, movement, or behavior in any way tested. Although age-1(hx546) lowers hermaphrodite self-fertility, it does not markedly affect the length of the reproductive period with all the increase in life expectancy due to an increase in the length of postreproductive life. In so far as we are aware, this mutant in age-1 is the only instance of a well-characterized genetic locus in which the mutant form results in lengthened fife. It is likely that the action of age-1 in lengthening life results not from eliminating a programmed aging function but rather from reduced hermaphrodite self-fertility or from some other unknown metabolic or physiologic alteration.},

abstract = {CORRESPONDENCE exploitation of more appropriate data. Recent successes in physics, such as the discovery of gravitational waves and the Higgs boson, illustrate the benefits of model-based experimentation very well. The biomedical field needs such examples of its own. We firmly believe that computational biologists can contrib-ute productively to model-driven experimental research. Models derived from more classical post-mortem data analysis should now guide the next wave of hypothesis generation, experimen-tal design and data collection. To identify biomedical problems ready to be tackled, we have invited computational biologists from around the world to take part in the Idea DREAM Challenge (http://tinyurl.com/dreamidea). Participants were asked to propose biomedical research questions for which computational models have exploited available data to the limit and are ready to guide new data collection efforts to move the field forward. Through peer review and discussions among participants, we selected two winning ideas. We are now matching the winning participants with wet-lab researchers to generate the necessary data. The first idea addresses the challenge of drug–target interac-tion mapping. The potential chemical space of drug-like com-pounds is thought to contain on the order of 10 20 molecules, making exhaustive exploration infeasible. Furthermore, currently available bioactivity measurements vary greatly between labs and assay types, and hence are not yet sufficient to reliably guide the computational prediction of compound–target relationships at a large scale. One of the winning DREAM ideas proposed a model-guided experimental design and mapping effort to prioritize the most potent target selectivity experiments among the massive search space of compounds and their potential targets. Such tar-geted experiments, which will be predicted by computational models, are expected to offer a cost-effective alternative to the more systematic exploration efforts, effectively providing higher information content with the same amount of experiments. The other winning DREAM idea tackles the problem of regula-tory network inference, predicting which regulatory proteins con-trol the expression of which target genes. The proposal is to sys-tematically and iteratively collect multi-omic measurements under different genetic and environmental perturbations from both bulk populations and single cells. These data will be collected in a model-guided manner, in which the initial model is a consensus derived from published datasets to avoid duplication of experimental effort and enable maximal discovery. The resulting dataset will serve as a better gold standard to validate computational predictions from existing and new inference methods and will help identify the most informative datasets for regulatory network discovery. We envision that the Idea DREAM Challenge is just the beginning of many more endeavors in which data analysts and computational biologists can be actively engaged in all stages of the scientific pro-cess. Model builders and experimentalists would benefit from work-ing together to design better studies that will accelerate scientific discovery. To the Editor: Over the last two decades researchers have wit-nessed an explosion in the amount and diversity of data col-lected in biological and medical studies. These data are often generated without the input of those who will later analyze it. Computational analyses are therefore, in the words of statisti-cian Ronald Fisher, mostly performed 'post mortem' . We believe that a more efficient scientific process should use computational modeling based on previously acquired data to guide targeted data collection efforts. We consider systematic data collection and model-driven data collection as distinct efforts. Large-scale systematic data collec-tion efforts, such as TCGA, ENCODE, REMC, GTEx and the Connectivity Map, to name a few, have unquestionably led to important and actionable findings such as identifying treat-ment targets (https://cancergenome.nih.gov/researchhighlights/ tcgainaction/tcga-data-used-for-loxo101-drug-development) and gaining insight into gene regulatory processes 1 . However, such data could have been even more useful. For example, in our own work on glioblastoma subtype discovery 2 , we could use only 46{\%} of the TCGA samples because of missing measure-ments, reducing the power of the study. In another example, the fixed concentration levels of small-molecule compounds in the Connectivity Map were suboptimal for some compounds and cell contexts, leading to substantial batch effects 3 . DREAM Challenges, which harness the collective skills of computational biologists across the world to solve biologi-cal and medical problems using 'data of convenience', have illustrated the difficulties in this process 4–6 . For instance, in a DREAM challenge for predicting response to drugs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, using the largest available collection of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data did not improve predictions over those obtained using the clinical predictors 5 . In a toxicogenetic challenge, genome-wide association study (GWAS) data by themselves were not predictive, but the results were markedly better when these were taken together with RNA-seq data, available for only 38{\%} of the patients 4 . Finally, in a DREAM challenge assessing and improving drug sensitivity prediction algorithms, having data from many omics modalities did not provide an advantage over the use of gene expression data alone 6 . We concede that these situations may arise because some computational approaches are just not good enough for the task. However, the fact that none of several dozen independent expert teams were successful in solving the problems using the same data suggests that, instead, more or different kinds of data may be needed. The question then arises: How can one efficiently determine which data we need to, rather than can, measure to accelerate scientific discovery? Hypothesis-driven experiments are common in the life sci-ences but tend to be small in scale. We argue that computational models, capable of generating targeted hypotheses that capture the complexity of biological systems, should be used to guide data collection. This offers the possibility not only of speeding up data collection but also of yielding better biological insights, thanks to the},

abstract = {Individuals suffering from Werner syndrome (WS) exhibit many clinical signs of accelerated aging. While the underlying constitutional mutation leads to accelerated rates of DNA damage, it is not yet known whether WS is also associated with an increased epigenetic age according to a DNA methylation based biomarker of aging (the "Epigenetic Clock"). Using whole blood methylation data from 18 WS cases and 18 age matched controls, we find that WS is associated with increased extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (p=0.0072) and intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (p=0.04), the latter of which is independent of age-related changes in the composition of peripheral blood cells. A multivariate model analysis reveals that WS is associated with an increase in DNA methylation age (on average 6.4 years, p=0.011) even after adjusting for chronological age, gender, and blood cell counts. Further, WS might be associated with a reduction in na{\"{i}}ve CD8+ T cells (p=0.025) according to imputed measures of blood cell counts. Overall, this study shows that WS is associated with an increased epigenetic age of blood cells which is independent of changes in blood cell composition. The extent to which this alteration is a cause or effect of WS disease phenotypes remains unknown.},

abstract = {Whole-genome sequencing is a powerful tool for analyzing genetic variation on a global scale. One particularly useful application is the identification of mutations obtained by classical phenotypic screens in model species. Sequence data from the mutant strain is aligned to the reference genome, and then variants are called to generate a list of candidate alleles. A number of software pipelines for mutation identification have been targeted to C. elegans, with particular emphasis on ease of use, incorporation of mapping strain data, subtraction of background variants, and similar criteria. Although success is predicated upon the sensitive and accurate detection of candidate alleles, relatively little effort has been invested in evaluating the underlying software components that are required for mutation identification. Therefore, we have benchmarked a number of commonly used tools for sequence alignment and variant calling, in all pair-wise combinations, against both simulated and actual datasets. We compared the accuracy of those pipelines for mutation identification in C. elegans, and found that the combination of BBMap for alignment plus FreeBayes for variant calling offers the most robust performance.},

Here we demonstrate that high and low molecular weight double-stranded DNA, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), and RNA can be separated rapidly in agarose-based low-molarity conductive media. Separation of small DNA fragments was optimized by substituting 1-mM solutions of alkali metals or a nonbiological amine that distributed voltage with a minute current. These ultra-dilute solutions can separate DNA at least 15-fold faster Low-molarity media at 5-10 mM adequately separated RNA and larger DNA fragments as well. These novel media reduce the Joule heating of the electrophoretic system and allow for easy-to-use, ultra-fast separation of DNA fragments.},

Thus, the 5-methyldeoxycytidine content of DNAs, isolated from the tissues of two rodent species of various ages, were determined. Mus musculus lost DNA methylation sites at a rate of about 4.7 X 10(4) (approximately 0.012{\%} of the newborn level)/month. Peromyscus leucopus lost DNA 5-methyldeoxycytidine residues at a rate of only 2.3 X 10(4) (approximately 0.006{\%} of the newborn level)/month. Since P. leucopus generally live twice as long as M. musculus, the rate of loss of DNA 5-methyldeoxycytidine residues appears to be inversely related to life span. Similar losses in genomic 5-methyldeoxycytidine content were also observed to correlate with donor age in cultured normal human bronchial epithelial cells.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved. Transcription requires unwinding complementary DNA strands, generating torsional stress, and sensitizing the exposed single strands to chemical reactions and endogenous damaging agents. In addition, transcription can occur concomitantly with the other major DNA metabolic processes (replication, repair, and recombination), creating opportunities for either cooperation or conflict. Genetic modifications associated with transcription are a global issue in the small genomes of microorganisms in which noncoding sequences are rare. Transcription likewise becomes significant when one considers that most of the human genome is transcriptionally active. In this review, we focus specifically on the mutagenic consequences of transcription. Mechanisms of transcription-Associated mutagenesis in microorganisms are discussed, as is the role of transcription in  somatic instability of the vertebrate immune system.},

abstract = {Synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (sSNPs) are considered neutral for protein function, as by definition they exchange only codons, not amino acids. We identified an sSNP that modifies the local translation speed of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conduc-tance regulator (CFTR), leading to detrimental changes to protein stability and function. This sSNP introduces a codon pairing to a low-abundance tRNA that is particularly rare in human bronchial epithelia, but not in other human tissues, suggesting tissue-specific effects of this sSNP. Up-regulation of the tRNA cognate to the mutated codon counteracts the effects of the sSNP and rescues protein conformation and function. Our results highlight the wide-ranging impact of sSNPs, which invert the programmed local speed of mRNA translation and provide direct evidence for the central role of cellular tRNA levels in mediating the actions of sSNPs in a tissue-specific manner.},

abstract = {Micronemal protein 2 (MIC2) is the key adhesin that supports gliding motility and host cell invasion by Toxoplasma gondii. With a von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domain and six thrombospondin repeat domains (TSR1-6) in its ectodomain, MIC2 connects to the parasite actomyosin system through its cytoplasmic tail. MIC2-associated protein (M2AP) binds noncovalently to the MIC2 ectodomain. MIC2 and M2AP are stored in micronemes as proforms. We find that the MIC2-M2AP ectodomain complex is a highly elongated 1:1 monomer with M2AP bound to the TSR6 domain. Crystal structures of N-terminal fragments containing the VWA and TSR1 domains for proMIC2 and MIC2 reveal a closed conformation of the VWA domain and how it associates with the TSR1 domain. A long, proline-rich, disulfide-bonded pigtail loop in TSR1 overlaps the VWA domain. Mannose $\alpha$-C-linked to Trp-276 in TSR1 has an unusual (1)C4 chair conformation. The MIC2 VWA domain includes a mobile $\alpha$5-helix and a 22-residue disordered region containing two disulfide bonds in place of an $\alpha$6-helix. A hydrophobic residue in the prodomain binds to a pocket adjacent to the $\alpha$7-helix that pistons in opening of the VWA domain to a putative high-affinity state.},

C666-1 is a subclone of its parental cell line, C666, derived from an NPC xenograft of southern Chinese origin. It grows as an adherent culture and lacks contact inhibition. In addition, it is tumorigenic in athymic nude mice. The cells consistently express EBV-encoded RNAs and are positively stained for cytokeratin, an epithelial marker. In addition, they express EBNA1 protein, LMP1 and LMP2 transcripts and thus resemble the EBV latency II pattern. The virus genotype is EBV-1 with the latent membrane protein 1 gene showing a 30-bp deletion at the carboxyl terminus, both consistent with findings in southern Chinese NPC tumours. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a sub-diploid status with a chromosomal modal number of 45. C666-1 is unique among NPC cell lines in that it carries EBV. These cells may serve as a good investigative tool as the viral latency pattern and genotype are observed in the majority of primary NPC biopsies from Chinese patients.},

Sequence analysis reveals three classes of aa substitutions in GFP. All three classes of mutant proteins have highly shifted excitation maxima. In addition, when produced in E. coli, the folding of the mutant proteins is more efficient than folding of wt GFP. These two properties contribute to a greatly increased (100-fold) fluorescence intensity, making the mutants useful for a number of applications.},

HeLa cells cultured in suspension were analyzed at regular intervals along a normal growth curve.

Further, 11 different cell lines representing non-tumorigenic, tumorigenic, and virally-transformed tumorigenic types from Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, and Rattus norvegicus were examined for MT-A70 mRNA expression. It was found that all the cell lines expressed a long and short splice-variant form of the gene. In general, the cell lines expressed a similar total amount of the MT-A70 mRNA while statistically significant differences existed between the quantity of the long and short forms among cell types. Tumorigenic cell lines synthesized as much as a 9-fold greater amount of long form versus short form MT-A70 mRNA. Comparatively, non-tumorigenic cell lines generally expressed only a 1.5-fold greater amount of long form versus short form MT-A70 mRNA.},

abstract = {We study the interrelations between tRNA gene copy numbers, gene expression levels and measures of codon bias in the human genome. First, we show that isoaccepting tRNA gene copy numbers correlate positively with expression-weighted frequencies of amino acids and codons. Using expression data of more than 14,000 human genes, we show a weak positive correlation between gene expression level and frequency of optimal codons (codons with highest tRNA gene copy number). Interestingly, contrary to non-mammalian eukaryotes, codon bias tends to be high in both highly expressed genes and lowly expressed genes. We suggest that selection may act on codon bias, not only to increase elongation rate by favoring optimal codons in highly expressed genes, but also to reduce elongation rate by favoring non-optimal codons in lowly expressed genes. We also show that the frequency of optimal codons is in positive correlation with estimates of protein biosynthetic cost, and suggest another possible action of selection on codon bias: preference of optimal codons as production cost rises, to reduce the rate of amino acid misincorporation. In the analyses of this work, we introduce a new measure of frequency of optimal codons (FOP'), which is unaffected by amino acid composition and is corrected for background nucleotide content; we also introduce a new method for computing expected codon frequencies, based on the dinucleotide composition of the introns and the non-coding regions surrounding a gene.},

abstract = {N(6)-methyladenosine is a nonediting RNA modification found in mRNA of all eukaryotes, from yeast to humans. Although the functional significance of N(6)-methyladenosine is unknown, the Inducer of MEiosis 4 (IME4) gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which encodes the enzyme that catalyzes this modification, is required for gametogenesis. Here we find that the Drosophila IME4 homolog, Dm ime4, is expressed in ovaries and testes, indicating an evolutionarily conserved function for this enzyme in gametogenesis. In contrast to yeast, but as in Arabidopsis, Dm ime4 is essential for viability. Lethality is rescued fully by a wild-type transgenic copy of Dm ime4 but not by introducing mutations shown to abrogate the catalytic activity of yeast Ime4, indicating functional conservation of the catalytic domain. The phenotypes of hypomorphic alleles of Dm ime4 that allow recovery of viable adults reveal critical functions for this gene in oogenesis. Ovarioles from Dm ime4 mutants have fused egg chambers with follicle-cell defects similar to those observed when Notch signaling is defective. Indeed, using a reporter for Notch activation, we find markedly reduced levels of Notch signaling in follicle cells of Dm ime4 mutants. This phenotype of Dm ime4 mutants is rescued by inducing expression of a constitutively activated form of Notch. Our study reveals the function of IME4 in a metazoan. In yeast, this enzyme is responsible for a crucial developmental decision, whereas in Drosophila it appears to target the conserved Notch signaling pathway, which regulates many vital aspects of metazoan development.},

abstract = {In bacteria, one of the major transcriptional termination mechanisms requires a RNA/DNA helicase known as the Rho factor. We have determined two structures of Rho complexed with nucleic acid recognition site mimics in both free and nucleotide bound states to 3.0 A resolution. Both structures show that Rho forms a hexameric ring in which two RNA binding sites--a primary one responsible for target mRNA recognition and a secondary one required for mRNA translocation and unwinding--point toward the center of the ring. Rather than forming a closed ring, the Rho hexamer is split open, resembling a "lock washer" in its global architecture. The distance between subunits at the opening is sufficiently wide (12 A) to accommodate single-stranded RNA. This open configuration most likely resembles a state poised to load onto mRNA and suggests how related ring-shaped enzymes may be breached to bind nucleic acids.},

abstract = {EXORIBONUCLEASE4 (XRN4), the Arabidopsis thaliana homolog of yeast XRN1, is involved in the degradation of several unstable mRNAs. Although a role for XRN4 in RNA silencing of certain transgenes has been reported, xrn4 mutant plants were found to lack any apparent visible phenotype. Here, we show that XRN4 is allelic to the unidentified components of the ethylene response pathway ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE5/ACC-INSENSITIVE1 (EIN5/AIN1) and EIN7. xrn4 mutant seedlings are ethylene-insensitive as a consequence of the upregulation of EIN3 BINDING F-BOX PROTEIN1 (EBF1) and EBF2 mRNA levels, which encode related F-box proteins involved in the turnover of EIN3 protein, a crucial transcriptional regulator of the ethylene response pathway. Epistasis analysis placed XRN4/EIN5/AIN1 downstream of CTR1 and upstream of EBF1/2. XRN4 does not appear to regulate ethylene signaling via an RNA-INDUCED SILENCING COMPLEX-based RNA silencing mechanism but acts by independent means. The identification of XRN4 as an integral new component in ethylene signaling adds RNA degradation as another posttranscriptional process that modulates the perception of this plant hormone.},

abstract = {Age-associated DNA methylation changes have been widely reported across many different tissue and cell types. Epigenetic 'clocks' that can predict chronological age with a surprisingly high degree of accuracy appear to do so independently of tissue and cell-type, suggesting that a component of epigenetic drift is cell-type independent. However, the relative amount of age-associated DNAm changes that are specific to a cell or tissue type versus the amount that occurs independently of cell or tissue type is unclear and a matter of debate, with a recent study concluding that most epigenetic drift is tissue-specific. Here, we perform a novel comprehensive statistical analysis, including matched multi cell-type and multi-tissue DNA methylation profiles from the same individuals and adjusting for cell-type heterogeneity, demonstrating that a substantial amount of epigenetic drift, possibly over 70{\%}, is shared between significant numbers of different tissue/cell types. We further show that ELOVL2 is not unique and that many other CpG sites, some mapping to genes in the Wnt and glutamate receptor signaling pathways, are altered with age across at least 10 different cell/tissue types. We propose that while most age-associated DNAm changes are shared between cell-types that the putative functional effect is likely to be tissue-specific.},

We report the identification of a locus associated with human longevity in one of the chromosomal regions with the highest density of Alu elements, in 1p35. The locus, corresponding to a (TG)n microsatellite in the YTHDF2 gene, was identified by characterizing an "anonymous" marker detectable through inter-Alu fingerprinting, which previously evidenced an increased homozygosity in centenarians. After genotyping 412 participants of different ages, including 137 centenarians, we confirmed the increased homozygosity in centenarians at this locus, and observed a concomitantly increased frequency of the most frequent allele and the corresponding homozygous genotype. Remarkably, the same genotype was associated with increased YTHDF2 messenger RNA levels in immortalized lymphocytes. Finally, YTHDF2 messenger RNA resulted to be mainly expressed in testis and placenta. The data suggest a possible role of this locus in human longevity.},

abstract = {Age is the main risk factor for the prevalent diseases of developed countries: cancer, cardiovascular disease and neurodegeneration. The ageing process is deleterious for fitness, but can nonetheless evolve as a consequence of the declining force of natural selection at later ages, attributable to extrinsic hazards to survival: ageing can then occur as a side-effect of accumulation of mutations that lower fitness at later ages, or of natural selection in favour of mutations that increase fitness of the young but at the cost of a higher subsequent rate of ageing. Once thought of as an inexorable, complex and lineage-specific process of accumulation of damage, ageing has turned out to be influenced by mechanisms that show strong evolutionary conservation. Lowered activity of the nutrient-sensing insulin/insulin-like growth factor/Target of Rapamycin signalling network can extend healthy lifespan in yeast, multicellular invertebrates, mice and, possibly, humans. Mitochondrial activity can also promote ageing, while genome maintenance and autophagy can protect against it. We discuss the relationship between evolutionarily conserved mechanisms of ageing and disease, and the associated scientific challenges and opportunities. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Marin2017,
abstract = {Adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) acts as a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis by directly phosphorylating metabolic enzymes and nutrient transporters and by indirectly promoting the transactivation of nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and function. We explored the mechanism of AMPK-mediated induction of gene expression. We identified AMPK consensus phosphorylation sequences in three proteins involved in nucleosome remodeling: DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), retinoblastoma binding protein 7 (RBBP7), and histone acetyltransferase 1 (HAT1). DNMT1 mediates DNA methylation that limits transcription factor access to promoters and is inhibited by RBBP7. Acetylation of histones by HAT1 creates a more relaxed chromatin-DNA structure that favors transcription. AMPK-mediated phosphorylation resulted in the activation of HAT1 and inhibition of DNMT1. For DNMT1, this inhibition was both a direct effect of phosphorylation and the result of increased interaction with RBBP7. In human umbilical vein cells, pharmacological AMPK activation or pulsatile shear stress triggered nucleosome remodeling and decreased cytosine methylation, leading to increased expression of nuclear genes encoding factors involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and function, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1$\alpha$ (PGC-1$\alpha$), transcription factor A (Tfam), and uncoupling proteins 2 and 3 (UCP2 and UCP3). Similar effects were seen in the aortas of mice given pharmacological AMPK activators, and these effects required AMPK2$\alpha$. These results enhance our understanding of AMPK-mediated mitochondrial gene expression through nucleosome remodeling.},

abstract = {The physical nature of the bacterial cytoplasm is poorly understood even though it determines cytoplasmic dynamics and hence cellular physiology and behavior. Through single-particle tracking of protein filaments, plasmids, storage granules, and foreign particles of different sizes, we find that the bacterial cytoplasm displays properties that are characteristic of glass-forming liquids and changes from liquid-like to solid-like in a component size-dependent fashion. As a result, the motion of cytoplasmic components becomes disproportionally constrained with increasing size. Remarkably, cellular metabolism fluidizes the cytoplasm, allowing larger components to escape their local environment and explore larger regions of the cytoplasm. Consequently, cytoplasmic fluidity and dynamics dramatically change as cells shift between metabolically active and dormant states in response to fluctuating environments. Our findings provide insight into bacterial dormancy and have broad implications to our understanding of bacterial physiology, as the glassy behavior of the cytoplasm impacts all intracellular processes involving large components.},

abstract = {The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans responds to overcrowding and scarcity of food by arresting development as a dauer larva, a nonfeeding, long-lived, stress-resistant, alternative third-larval stage. Previous work has shown that mutations in the genes daf-2 (encoding a member of the insulin receptor family) and age-1 (encoding a PI 3-kinase) result in constitutive formation of dauer larvae (Daf-c), increased adult longevity (Age), and increased intrinsic thermotolerance (Itt). Some daf-2 mutants have additional developmental, behavioral, and reproductive defects. We have characterized in detail 15 temperature-sensitive and 1 nonconditional daf-2 allele to investigate the extent of daf-2 mutant defects and to examine whether specific mutant traits correlate with each other. The greatest longevity seen in daf-2 mutant adults was approximately three times that of wild type. The temperature-sensitive daf-2 mutants fell into two overlapping classes, including eight class 1 mutants, which are Daf-c, Age, and Itt, and exhibit low levels of L1 arrest at 25.5 degrees. Seven class 2 mutants also exhibit the class 1 defects as well as some or all of the following: reduced adult motility, abnormal adult body and gonad morphology, high levels of embryonic and L1 arrest, production of progeny late in life, and reduced brood size. The strengths of the Daf-c, Age, and Itt phenotypes largely correlated with each other but not with the strength of class 2-specific defects. This suggests that the DAF-2 receptor is bifunctional. Examination of the null phenotype revealed a maternally rescued egg, L1 lethal component, and a nonconditional Daf-c component. With respect to the Daf-c phenotype, the dauer-defective (Daf-d) mutation daf-12(m20) was epistatic to daf-2 class 1 alleles but not the severe class 2 alleles tested. All daf-2 mutant defects were suppressed by the daf-d mutation daf-16(m26). Our findings suggest a new model for daf-2, age-1, daf-12, and daf-16 interactions.},

abstract = {This article presents methods for sample size and power calculations for studies involving linear regression. These approaches are applicable to clinical trials designed to detect a regression slope of a given magnitude or to studies that test whether the slopes or intercepts of two independent regression lines differ by a given amount. The investigator may either specify the values of the independent (x) variable(s) of the regression line(s) or determine them observationally when the study is performed. In the latter case, the investigator must estimate the standard deviation(s) of the independent variable(s). This study gives examples using this method for both experimental and observational study designs. Cohen's method of power calculations for multiple linear regression models is also discussed and contrasted with the methods of this study. We have posted a computer program to perform these and other sample size calculations on the Internet (see http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/prevmed/psintro.htm). This program can determine the sample size needed to detect a specified alternative hypothesis with the required power, the power with which a specific alternative hypothesis can be detected with a given sample size, or the specific alternative hypotheses that can be detected with a given power and sample size. Context-specific help messages available on request make the use of this software largely self-explanatory. Copyright (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.},

abstract = {Previously we have demonstrated that the U2 snRNA genes from the higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana contain two upstream elements, the USE with sequence RTCCCACATCG and a -30 'TATA' box, which are essential for transcription by RNA polymerase II, and that the conserved spacing of about four helical DNA turns between these elements is important for optimal promoter function. We have now isolated three genes encoding U6 RNA in Arabidopsis. Transcription of these genes in transfected protoplasts of Nicotiana plumbaginifolia is resistant to alpha-amanitin indicating that they are transcribed by RNA polymerase III. The upstream regions of three Arabidopsis U6 genes contain USE and -30 TATA-like elements similar to those found to be important for transcription of U2 RNA genes but the spacing between the two elements is about 10 bp closer than in the U2 genes. Using synthetic U6 genes we demonstrate that the USE and TATA elements are indispensable for their transcription, the TATA boxes of U2 and U6 genes are interchangeable, and that the intragenic A box-like sequence of U6 gene is not essential. Increasing the distance between the USE and TATA by 10 bp inactivates U6 gene transcription, demonstrating that proper positioning of the elements is also important for transcription by RNA polymerase III. The data indicate that the structure of U-snRNA gene promoters and the determinants of polymerase specificity are completely different between vertebrates and plants.},

abstract = {In chronologically aging yeast, longevity can be extended by administering a caloric restriction (CR) diet or some small molecules. These life-extending interventions target the adaptable target of rapamycin (TOR) and cAMP/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) signaling pathways that are under the stringent control of calorie availability. We designed a chemical genetic screen for small molecules that increase the chronological life span of yeast under CR by targeting lipid metabolism and modulating housekeeping longevity pathways that regulate longevity irrespective of the number of available calories. Our screen identifies lithocholic acid (LCA) as one of such molecules. We reveal two mechanisms underlying the life-extending effect of LCA in chronologically aging yeast. One mechanism operates in a calorie availability-independent fashion and involves the LCA-governed modulation of housekeeping longevity assurance pathways that do not overlap with the adaptable TOR and cAMP/PKA pathways. The other mechanism extends yeast longevity under non-CR conditions and consists in LCA-driven unmasking of the previously unknown anti-aging potential of PKA. We provide evidence that LCA modulates housekeeping longevity assurance pathways by suppressing lipid-induced necrosis, attenuating mitochondrial fragmentation, altering oxidation-reduction processes in mitochondria, enhancing resistance to oxidative and thermal stresses, suppressing mitochondria-controlled apoptosis, and enhancing stability of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA.},

abstract = {DNA methylation (DNAm)-based biomarkers of aging have been developed for many tissues and organs. However, these biomarkers have sub-optimal accuracy in fibroblasts and other cell types used in ex vivo studies. To address this challenge, we developed a novel and highly robust DNAm age estimator (based on 391 CpGs) for human fibroblasts, keratinocytes, buccal cells, endothelial cells, lymphoblastoid cells, skin, blood, and saliva samples. High age correlations can also be observed in sorted neurons, glia, brain, liver, and even bone samples. Gestational age correlates with DNAm age in cord blood. When used on fibroblasts from Hutchinson Gilford Progeria Syndrome patients, this age estimator (referred to as the skin {\&} blood clock) uncovered an epigenetic age acceleration with a magnitude that is below the sensitivity levels of other DNAm-based biomarkers. Furthermore, this highly sensitive age estimator accurately tracked the dynamic aging of cells cultured ex vivo and revealed that their proliferation is accompanied by a steady increase in epigenetic age. The skin {\&} blood clock predicts lifespan and it relates to many age-related conditions. Overall, this biomarker is expected to become useful for forensic applications (e.g. blood or buccal swabs) and for a quantitative ex vivo human cell aging assay.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a lysosome-mediated self-degradation process of eukaryotic cells that, depending on the cellular milieu, can either promote survival or act as an alternative mechanism of programmed cell death (PCD) in terminally differentiated cells. Despite the important developmental and medical implications of autophagy and the main form of PCD, apoptosis, orchestration of their regulation remains poorly understood. Here, we show in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, that various genetic and pharmacological interventions causing embryonic lethality trigger a massive cell death response that has both autophagic and apoptotic features. The two degradation processes are also redundantly required for normal development and viability in this organism. Furthermore, the CES-2-like basic region leucine-zipper (bZip) transcription factor ATF-2, an upstream modulator of the core apoptotic cell death pathway, is able to directly regulate the expression of at least two key autophagy-related genes, bec-1/ATG6 and lgg-1/ATG8. Thus, the two cell death mechanisms share a common method of transcriptional regulation. Together, these results imply that under certain physiological and pathological conditions, autophagy and apoptosis are co-regulated to ensure the proper morphogenesis and survival of the developing organism. The identification of apoptosis and autophagy as compensatory cellular pathways in C. elegans might help us to understand how dysregulated PCD in humans can lead to diverse pathologies, including cancer, neurodegeneration and diabetes.},

abstract = {Cytosine methylation is required for mammalian development and is often perturbed in human cancer. To determine how this epigenetic modification is distributed in the genomes of primary and transformed cells, we used an immunocapturing approach followed by DNA microarray analysis to generate methylation profiles of all human chromosomes at 80-kb resolution and for a large set of CpG islands. In primary cells we identified broad genomic regions of differential methylation with higher levels in gene-rich neighborhoods. Female and male cells had indistinguishable profiles for autosomes but differences on the X chromosome. The inactive X chromosome (Xi) was hypermethylated at only a subset of gene-rich regions and, unexpectedly, overall hypomethylated relative to its active counterpart. The chromosomal methylation profile of transformed cells was similar to that of primary cells. Nevertheless, we detected large genomic segments with hypomethylation in the transformed cell residing in gene-poor areas. Furthermore, analysis of 6,000 CpG islands showed that only a small set of promoters was methylated differentially, suggesting that aberrant methylation of CpG island promoters in malignancy might be less frequent than previously hypothesized.},

Results: We have developed meffil, an R package designed for efficient quality control, normalization and epigenome-wide association studies of large samples of Illumina Methylation BeadChip microarrays. A complete re-implementation of functional normalization minimizes computational memory without increasing running time. Incorporating fixed and random effects within functional normalization, and automated estimation of functional normalization parameters reduces technical variation in DNA methylation levels, thus reducing false positive rates and improving power. Support for normalization of datasets distributed across physically different locations without needing to share biologically-based individual-level data means that meffil can be used to reduce heterogeneity in meta-analyses of epigenome-wide association studies.

abstract = {Background/Aims: The maximum lifespan of the naked mole rat is over 28.3 years, which exceeds that of any other rodent species, suggesting that age-related changes in its body composition and functionality are either attenuated or delayed in this extraordinarily long-lived species. However, the mechanisms underlying the aging process in this species are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated whether long-lived naked mole rats display more autophagic activity than short-lived mice. Methods: Hepatic stellate cells isolated from naked mole rats were treated with 50 nM rapamycin or 20 mM 3-methyladenine (3-MA) for 12 or 24 h. Expression of the autophagy marker proteins LC3-II and beclin 1 was measured with western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The induction of apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. Results: Our results demonstrate that one-day-old naked mole rats have higher levels of autophagy than one-day-old short-lived C57BL/6 mice, and that both adult naked mole rats (eight months old) and adult C57BL/6 mice (eight weeks old) have high basal levels of autophagy, which may be an important mechanism inhibiting aging and reducing the risk of age-related diseases. Conclusion: Here, we report that autophagy facilitated the survival of hepatic stellate cells from the naked mole rat, and that treatment with 3-MA or rapamycin increased the ratio of apoptotic cells to normal hepatic stellate cells.

Previous studies have proposed that APOBEC3B (A3B) is the major source of mutagenesis in breast cancer (BRCA). We show that APOBEC3A (A3A) is the only APOBEC whose expression correlates with APOBEC-induced mutation load and that A3A expression is responsible for cytidine deamination in multiple BRCA cell lines. Comparative analysis of A3A and A3B expression by qRT-PCR, RSEM-normalized RNA-seq, and unambiguous RNA-seq validated the use of RNA-seq to measure APOBEC expression, which indicates that A3A is the primary correlate with APOBEC-mutation load in primary BRCA tumors. We also demonstrate that A3A has {\textgreater}100-fold more cytidine deamination activity than A3B in the presence of cellular RNA, likely explaining why higher levels of A3B expression contributes less to mutagenesis in BRCA. Our findings identify A3A as a major source of cytidine deaminase activity in breast cancer cells and possibly a prominent contributor to the APOBEC mutation signature.},

abstract = {CpG islands (CGI) are critical genomic regulatory elements that support transcriptional initiation and are associated with the promoters of most human genes. CGI are distinguished from the bulk genome by their high CpG density, lack of DNA methylation, and euchromatic features. While CGI are canonically known as strong promoters, thousands of 'orphan' CGI lie far from any known transcript, leaving their function an open question. We undertook a comprehensive analysis of the epigenetic state of orphan CGI across over 100 cell types. Here we show that most orphan CGI display the chromatin features of active enhancers (H3K4me1, H3K27Ac) in at least one cell type. Relative to classical enhancers, these enhancer CGI (ECGI) are stronger, as gauged by chromatin state and in functional assays, are more broadly expressed, and are more highly conserved. Likewise, ECGI engage in more genomic contacts and are enriched for transcription factor binding relative to classical enhancers. In human cancers, these epigenetic differences between ECGI vs. classical enhancers manifest in distinct alterations in DNA methylation. Thus, ECGI define a class of highly active enhancers, strengthened by the broad transcriptional activity, CpG density, hypomethylation, and chromatin features they share with promoter CGI. In addition to indicating a role for thousands of orphan CGI, these findings suggests that enhancer activity may be an intrinsic function of CGI in general and provides new insights into the evolution of enhancers and their epigenetic regulation during development and tumorigenesis.},

Inspired by the activities of the FORCE11 working group focused on data citation, this document summarizes the recommendations of the FORCE11 Software Citation Working Group and its activities between June 2015 and April 2016. Based on a review of existing community practices, the goal of the working group was to produce a consolidated set of citation principles that may encourage broad adoption of a consistent policy for software citation across disciplines and venues. Our work is presented here as a set of software citation principles, a discussion of the motivations for developing the principles, reviews of existing community practice, and a discussion of the requirements these principles would place upon different stakeholders. Working examples and possible technical solutions for how these principles can be implemented will be discussed in a separate paper.},

abstract = {Myxococcus xanthus moves by gliding motility powered by type IV pili (S-motility) and distributed motor complexes (A-motility). The Frz chemosensory pathway controls reversals for both motility systems. However, it is unclear how the Frz pathway can communicate with these different systems. In this article, we show that FrzCD, the Frz pathway receptor, interacts with AglZ, a protein associated with A-motility. Affinity chromatography and cross-linking experiments showed that the FrzCD-AglZ interaction occurs between the uncharacterized N-terminal region of FrzCD and the N-terminal pseudo-receiver domain of AglZ. Fluorescence microscopy showed AglZ-mCherry and FrzCD-GFP localized in clusters that occupy different positions in cells. To study the role of the Frz system in the regulation of A-motility, we constructed aglZ frzCD double mutants and aglZ frzCD pilA triple mutants. To our surprise, these mutants, predicted to show no A-motility (A-S+) or no motility at all (A-S-), respectively, showed restored A-motility. These results indicate that AglZ modulates a FrzCD activity that inhibits A-motility. We hypothesize that AglZ-FrzCD interactions are favoured when cells are isolated and moving by A-motility and inhibited when S-motility predominates and A-motility is reduced.},

abstract = {NEDL1 (NEDD4-like ubiquitin protein ligase-1) is a newly identified HECT-type E3 ubiquitin protein ligase highly expressed in favorable neuroblastomas as compared with unfavorable ones. In this study, we found that NEDL1 cooperates with p53 to induce apoptosis. During cisplatin (CDDP)-mediated apoptosis in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, p53 was induced to accumulate in association with an increase in expression levels of NEDL1. Enforced expression of NEDL1 resulted in a decrease in number of G418-resistant colonies in SH-SY5Y and U2OS cells bearing wild-type p53, whereas NEDL1 had undetectable effect on p53-deficient H1299 and SAOS-2 cells. Similarly, enforced expression of NEDL1 increased number of U2OS cells with sub-G1 DNA content. Co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding assays revealed that NEDL1 binds to the COOH-terminal region of p53. Luciferase reporter assay showed that NEDL1 has an ability to enhance the transcriptional activity of p53. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of the endogenous NEDL1 conferred the resistance of U2OS cells to adriamycin. It is noteworthy that NEDL1 enhanced pro-apoptotic activity of p53 in its catalytic activity-independent manner. Taken together, our present findings suggest that functional interaction of NEDL1 with p53 might contribute to the induction of apoptosis in cancerous cells bearing wild-type p53.},

abstract = {Background: DNA methylation is influenced by both environmental and genetic factors and is increasingly thought to affect variation in complex traits and diseases. Yet, the extent of ancestry-related differences in DNA methylation, their genetic determinants, and their respective causal impact on immune gene regulation remain elusive. Results: We report extensive population differences in DNA methylation between 156 individuals of African and European descent, detected in primary monocytes that are used as a model of a major innate immunity cell type. Most of these differences ({\~{}} 70{\%}) are driven by DNA sequence variants nearby CpG sites, which account for {\~{}} 60{\%} of the variance in DNA methylation. We also identify several master regulators of DNA methylation variation in trans, including a regulatory hub nearby the transcription factor-encoding CTCF gene, which contributes markedly to ancestry-related differences in DNA methylation. Furthermore, we establish that variation in DNA methylation is associated with varying gene expression levels following mostly, but not exclusively, a canonical model of negative associations, particularly in enhancer regions. Specifically, we find that DNA methylation highly correlates with transcriptional activity of 811 and 230 genes, at the basal state and upon immune stimulation, respectively. Finally, using a Bayesian approach, we estimate causal mediation effects of DNA methylation on gene expression in {\~{}} 20{\%} of the studied cases, indicating that DNA methylation can play an active role in immune gene regulation. Conclusion: Using a system-level approach, our study reveals substantial ancestry-related differences in DNA methylation and provides evidence for their causal impact on immune gene regulation.},

abstract = {Sex-lethal (Sxl) is a central switch gene in somatic sexual development of Drosophila melanogaster. Female-specific expression of Sxl relies on autoregulatory splicing of Sxl pre-mRNA by SXL protein. This process requires the function of virilizer (vir). Besides its role in Sxl splicing, vir is essential for male and female viability and is also required for the production of eggs capable of embryonic development. We have identified vir molecularly and found that it produces a single transcript of 6 kb that is ubiquitously expressed in male and female embryos throughout development. This transcript encodes a nuclear protein of 210 kD that cannot be assigned to a known protein family. VIR contains a putative transmembrane domain, a coiled-coil region and PEST sequences. We have characterized five different alleles of vir. Those alleles that affect both sexes are associated with large truncations of the protein, while alleles that affect only the female-specific functions are missense mutations that lie relatively close to each other, possibly defining a region important for the regulation of Sxl.},

abstract = {In female m ammals, one of the two X chromosomes in each cell is transcriptionally silenced in order to achieve dosage compensation between the genders in a process called X chromosome inactivation. The master regulator of this process is the long non-coding RNA Xist. During X-inactivation, Xist accumulates in cis on the future inactive X chromosome, triggering a cascade of events that provoke the stable silencing of the entire chromosome, with relatively few genes remaining active. How Xist spreads, what are its binding sites, how it recruits silencing factors and how it induces a specific topological and nuclear organization of the chromatin all remain largely unanswered questions. Recent studies have improved our understanding of Xist localization and the proteins with which it interacts, allowing a reappraisal of ideas about Xist function. We discuss recent advances in our knowledge of Xist-mediated silencing, focusing on Xist spreading, the nuclear organization of the inactive X chromosome, recruitment of the polycomb complex and the role of the nuclear matrix in the process of X chromosome inactivation.},

Previous studies showed that cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKI) induce autophagy. Whether retinoblastoma protein (RB), a key tumor suppressor and downstream target of CDKIs, induces autophagy is not clear. Here, we show that RB triggers autophagy and that the RB activators p16INK4a and p27/kip1 induce autophagy in an RB-dependent manner. RB binding to E2 transcription factor (E2F) is required for autophagy induction and E2F1 antagonizes RB-induced autophagy, leading to apoptosis. Downregulation of E2F1 in cells results in high levels of autophagy. Our findings indicate that RB induces autophagy by repressing E2F1 activity. We speculate that this newly discovered aspect of RB function is relevant to cancer development and therapy.},

abstract = {Regulatory change has long been hypothesized to drive the delineation of the human phenotype from other closely related primates. Here we provide evidence that CpG dinucleotides play a special role in this process. CpGs enable epigenome variability via DNA methylation, and this epigenetic mark functions as a regulatory mechanism. Therefore, species-specific CpGs may influence species-specific regulation. We report non-polymorphic species-specific CpG dinucleotides (termed "CpG beacons") as a distinct genomic feature associated with CpG island (CGI) evolution, human traits and disease. Using an inter-primate comparison, we identified 21 extreme CpG beacon clusters (≥ 20/kb peaks, empirical p {\textless} 1.0 × 10(-3)) in humans, which include associations with four monogenic developmental and neurological disease related genes (Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p = 6.03 × 10(-3)). We also demonstrate that beacon-mediated CpG density gain in CGIs correlates with reduced methylation in these species in orthologous CGIs over time, via human, chimpanzee and macaque MeDIP-seq. Therefore mapping into both the genomic and epigenomic space the identified CpG beacon clusters define points of intersection where a substantial two-way interaction between genetic sequence and epigenetic state has occurred. Taken together, our data support a model for CpG beacons to contribute to CGI evolution from genesis to tissue-specific to constitutively active CGIs.},

These observations indicate that the underlying DNA sequence largely accounts for local patterns of methylation. As a result, this mark is highly informative when studying gene regulation in normal and diseased cells, and it can potentially function as a biomarker. Although these findings challenge the view that methylation is generally instructive for gene silencing, several open questions remain, including how methylation is targeted and recognized and in what context it affects genome readout.},

This approach let us to distinguish different cells types based on their epigenomic profiles, thus recapitulating important aspects of human hematopoiesis. The analysis of the orthogonal dimension of the chromatin space identify 32,662 chromatin determinant regions (CDRs), genomic regions with different epigenetic characteristics between the cell types. Functional analysis revealed that these regions are linked with cell identities. The inclusion of leukemia epigenomes in the healthy hematological chromatin sample space gives us insights on the healthy cell types that are more epigenetically similar to the disease samples. Further analysis of tumoral epigenetic alterations in hematopoietic CDRs points to sets of genes that are tightly regulated in leukemic transformations and commonly mutated in other tumors. Our method provides an analytical approach to study the relationship between epigenomic changes and cell lineage differentiation. Method availability: https://github.com/david-juan/ChromDet.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The recent reports of two circular RNAs (circRNAs) with strong potential to act as microRNA (miRNA) sponges suggest that circRNAs might play important roles in regulating gene expression. However, the global properties of circRNAs are not well understood. RESULTS We developed a computational pipeline to identify circRNAs and quantify their relative abundance from RNA-seq data. Applying this pipeline to a large set of non-poly(A)-selected RNA-seq data from the ENCODE project, we annotated 7,112 human circRNAs that were estimated to comprise at least 10{\%} of the transcripts accumulating from their loci. Most circRNAs are expressed in only a few cell types and at low abundance, but they are no more cell-type-specific than are mRNAs with similar overall expression levels. Although most circRNAs overlap protein-coding sequences, ribosome profiling provides no evidence for their translation. We also annotated 635 mouse circRNAs, and although 20{\%} of them are orthologous to human circRNAs, the sequence conservation of these circRNA orthologs is no higher than that of their neighboring linear exons. The previously proposed miR-7 sponge, CDR1as, is one of only two circRNAs with more miRNA sites than expected by chance, with the next best miRNA-sponge candidate deriving from a gene encoding a primate-specific zinc-finger protein, ZNF91. CONCLUSIONS Our results provide a new framework for future investigation of this intriguing topological isoform while raising doubts regarding a biological function of most circRNAs.},

abstract = {DNA replication timing is known to facilitate the establishment of the epigenome, however, the intimate connection between replication timing and changes to the genome and epigenome in cancer remain largely uncharacterised. Here, we perform Repli-Seq and integrated epigenome analyses and demonstrate that genomic regions that undergo long-range epigenetic deregulation in prostate cancer also show concordant differences in replication timing. A subset of altered replication timing domains are conserved across cancers from different tissue origins. Notably, late-replicating regions in cancer cells display a loss of DNA methylation, and a switch in heterochromatin features from H3K9me3-marked constitutive to H3K27me3-marked facultative heterochromatin. Finally, analysis of 214 prostate and 35 breast cancer genomes reveal that late-replicating regions are prone to cis and early-replication to trans chromosomal rearrangements. Together, our data suggests that the nature of chromosomal rearrangement in cancer is related to the spatial and temporal positioning and altered epigenetic states of early-replicating compared to late-replicating loci.},

Although the vast majority of Alu elements appear to be genetically inert, it has been tempting to consider the great majority of them as "junk DNA." However, a growing line of evidence suggests that transcribed Alu RNAs are in fact functionally involved in a number of diverse biological processes. Pairs of inverted Alu repeats in RNA can form duplex structures that lead to A-to-I editing by the ADAR enzymes. In this review we discuss the possible biological effects of Alu editing, with particular focus on the regulation of gene expression by inverted Alu repeats in the 3′-UTR regions of mRNAs. {\textcopyright}2008 Landes Bioscience.},

abstract = {Originally discovered in plants, the phenomenon of co-suppression by transgenic DNA has since been observed in many organisms from fungi to animals: introduction of transgenic copies of a gene results in reduced expression of the transgene as well as the endogenous gene. The effect depends on sequence identity between transgene and endogenous gene. Some cases of co-suppression resemble RNA interference (the experimental silencing of genes by the introduction of double-stranded RNA), as RNA seems to be both an important initiator and a target in these processes. Here we show that co-suppression in Caenorhabditis elegans is also probably mediated by RNA molecules. Both RNA interference and co-suppression have been implicated in the silencing of transposons. We now report that mutants of C. elegans that are defective in transposon silencing and RNA interference (mut-2, mut-7, mut-8 and mut-9) are in addition resistant to co-suppression. This indicates that RNA interference and co-suppression in C. elegans may be mediated at least in part by the same molecular machinery, possibly through RNA-guided degradation of messenger RNA molecules.},

abstract = {Two-component signal transduction systems are the predominant means by which bacteria sense and respond to environmental stimuli. Bacteria often employ tens or hundreds of these paralogous signaling systems, comprised of histidine kinases (HKs) and their cognate response regulators (RRs). Faithful transmission of information through these signaling pathways and avoidance of detrimental crosstalk demand exquisite specificity of HK-RR interactions. To identify the determinants of two-component signaling specificity, we examined patterns of amino acid coevolution in large, multiple sequence alignments of cognate kinase-regulator pairs. Guided by these results, we demonstrate that a subset of the coevolving residues is sufficient, when mutated, to completely switch the substrate specificity of the kinase EnvZ. Our results shed light on the basis of molecular discrimination in two-component signaling pathways, provide a general approach for the rational rewiring of these pathways, and suggest that analyses of coevolution may facilitate the reprogramming of other signaling systems and protein-protein interactions.},

Apoptosis and senescence are the two major outcomes upon irreversible cellular damage. Here, we show a transition of these two cell fates during aging of telomerase deficient zebrafish. In young telomerase mutants, proliferative tissues exhibit DNA damage and p53-dependent apoptosis, but no senescence. However, these tissues in older animals display loss of cellularity and senescence becomes predominant. Tissue alterations are accompanied by a pro-proliferative stimulus mediated by AKT signaling. Upon AKT activation, FoxO transcription factors are phosphorylated and translocated out of the nucleus. This results in reduced SOD2 expression causing an increase of ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction. These alterations induce p15/16 growth arrest and senescence. We propose that, upon telomere shortening, early apoptosis leads to cell depletion and insufficient compensatory proliferation. Following tissue damage, the mTOR/AKT is activated causing mitochondrial dysfunction and p15/16-dependent senescence.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Ascl1 alone induced promoter CG methylation (mCG) of fibroblast specific genes, while BAM overexpression additionally targets a competing myogenic program and directs a more faithful conversion to neuronal cells. Ascl1 induces local demethylation at its binding sites. Surprisingly, co-expression with Brn2 and Mytl1 inhibited the ability of Ascl1 to induce demethylation, suggesting a contextual regulation of transcription factor - epigenome interaction. Finally, we found that de novo methylation by DNMT3A is required for efficient neuronal reprogramming.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic transcription factors (TFs) are key determinants of gene activity, yet they bind only a fraction of their corresponding DNA sequence motifs in any given cell type1. Chromatin has the potential to restrict accessibility of binding sites; however, in which context chromatin states are instructive for TF binding remains mainly unknown1,2. To explore the contribution of DNA methylation to constrained TF binding, we mapped DNase-I- hypersensitive sites in murine stem cells in the presence and absence of DNA methylation. Methylation-restricted sites are enriched for TF motifs containing CpGs, especially for those of NRF1. In fact, the TF NRF1 occupies several thousand additional sites in the unmethylated genome, resulting in increased transcription. Restoring de novo methyltransferase activity initiates remethylation at these sites and outcompetes NRF1 binding. This suggests that binding of DNA-methylation-sensitive TFs relies on additional determinants to induce local hypomethylation. In support of this model, removal of neighbouring motifs in cis or of a TF in trans causes local hypermethylation and subsequent loss of NRF1 binding. This competition between DNA methylation and TFs in vivo reveals a case of cooperativity between TFs that acts indirectly via DNA methylation. Methylation removal by methylation-insensitive factors enables occupancy of methylation-sensitive factors, a principle that rationalizes hypomethylation of regulatory regions. Methylation},

- DNAseI sites the digestion of which was restricted by methylation are enriched for TF motifs containing CpGs
**- Paricularly NRF1
- Resotring {\_}de novo{\_} methyl transferases initiates remehtylation - NRF1 doesnot protect the sites it binds from remethylation / is outcompeted by methyltransferases.
- methylation senstive TFs may requie additional factors to maintain hypomthylation at their binding sites - evidence is prodived that this is the case for NRF1 by removing TF binding sites in {\_}cis{\_} and TF in trans.

{\#}{\#}

- generally considered active regulatory regions are bound by TF and demethylated causal direction is unknown TF -{\textgreater} demeth, or demeth -{\textgreater} TF (prob both and TF depedent)
- REST and CTCF bind regions (methylation indpendently) and trigger demethylation
- Global DNA methylation through triple KO of DNMt1, DNMT3a/b is lethal in most tested mamalian cell types, murine ES cells are an exception.

{\#}{\#}{\#} DNAseI hypersensitiviey
- The Majority of DNAseI hypersensitivity sites (DHS) remain unchanged suggesting that the binding of most TFs in murine ES cells are unaffected by global loss of DNA demethylation
- A subset of DHSs reproducibly differ by wt vs TKO condition
**- These regions generally fall in locations distal from TSSs and in CpG poor regions
- Searching for know TF motifs and hexamers in these regions revealed a small number of candidate methylation senstive Tfs
**- Notably NRF1, GABPA, and MYCN
**- these TFs had binding motifs enriched in CpGs despite bing in generally CpG poor regions
**-their expression was similar in wt and TKO conditions
{\#}{\#}{\#} NRF1 in TKOs
- NRF1 binding motif contains 2 CpGs - suggesting direct sensitiveity to DNA methylation
- Previous {\_}in vitro{\_} work with NRF1 suggested tha mehtyaltion blocked binding but in contraction that it preffentialy binds methylated sequences (binary binding modes - scanning?)
-{\_}{\_} NRF1 is the only factor reported to bind its motif{\_}{\_}
- ChIP-seq of NRF1 in TKO found {\textgreater}7k binding sites in addition to wt sites
**- these sites correlate with TKO specific DHSs
**- manny sites showed poor sequence conservation in the surrounding regions suggesting they may be non-functional sites
- NRF1 binding results in a significant increase in the experssion of the nearest genes
- At some sites K3K27ac active regulatory marks are detected also Abberant transcripts directly from NRF1 binding sites are detected.
- NRF1 in TKO binds more strongly to motifs that are more methylates in wt and its binding is independent of CpG s in the surrounding sequence - arguing strong for direct effect of methylation on NRF1 binding
**- Example case where no other CpGs within 1.8k of the NRF1 binding site and binding is strictly methyltion dependent.
-
{\#}{\#}{\#} 2 kinase inhibitors (2i)
- mimic ICM of blastocyst coincides with {\_}de novo{\_} DNMTs downregulation
- allows for study of NRF1 at low levels of methylation without genetic interventions with DNMTs
- transfering cells from serum to 2i leads to increased NRF1 binding at the majority of sites identified in the TKO.
- Mehtylation profiling of these cells showed that at most sites where binding was not recapitulated the motif CpG sites where still methylated

{\#}{\#}{\#} effects of NRF1 binding on {\_}de novo{\_} methylation
- 2i cells transfered back to serum - derepressing DNMTs resulted in remethylation of most methylation dpendent NRF1 sites over time

{\#}{\#}{\#} effects of NRF1 expression
- expression levels fairly constant in previous work 
- 10x overexpression resulted in increased occupancy of wt binding sites and binding at other sites.
**- however the other sites bound did not overlap with methylation dependent sites, but contain weak motifs.

{\#}{\#}{\#} NRF in neuronal progenitors
- Differentiating ES cells to NPs results in a gain in methylation and reduced NRF1 binding at methylated NRF1 motifs as well as corresponding reduction in epxression of neighboring genes.

{\#}{\#}{\#} Generalisation of NRF1 behaviour
- Tight coupling of DNA methyaltion NRF1 binding and transcription holds true in human normal breast cells (HMEC) and breast cancer cell line (HCC1954) as well as (H1ESC and GM12878)

{\#}{\#}{\#} NRF1 reporter constructs
- insert unmethylated or premethylated promoters, NRF1 binds the unmethylated but not the methylated
- unlike CTCF
- NRF1 can bind following forced demethylation
- As NRF1 does not protect its binding sites from remethylation it likely cooperated with other TFs at promoters. Endogenous promoter constructs with and without CTCF and RFX motifs in addition to NRF1sites were used to test this.
**- lost of CTCF and RFX motifs leads to hypermethylation and reduce NRF1 binding.

{\#}{\#}{\#} Effects of REST deletion on NRF1
- REST creates regions of low methylationat its binding sites, it has not previously been functionally linked with NRF1
- Deletion of REST leads to loss of NRF1 binding at sites with adjacent REST and NRF1 motifs, but not in CpG islands which remain unmethylated with the loss of REST.},

@article{Wu2016,
abstract = {It has been widely accepted that 5-methylcytosine is the only form of DNA methylation in mammalian genomes. Here we identify N(6)-methyladenine as another form of DNA modification in mouse embryonic stem cells. Alkbh1 encodes a demethylase for N(6)-methyladenine. An increase of N(6)-methyladenine levels in Alkbh1-deficient cells leads to transcriptional silencing. N(6)-methyladenine deposition is inversely correlated with the evolutionary age of LINE-1 transposons; its deposition is strongly enriched at young ({\textless}1.5 million years old) but not old ({\textgreater}6 million years old) L1 elements. The deposition of N(6)-methyladenine correlates with epigenetic silencing of such LINE-1 transposons, together with their neighbouring enhancers and genes, thereby resisting the gene activation signals during embryonic stem cell differentiation. As young full-length LINE-1 transposons are strongly enriched on the X chromosome, genes located on the X chromosome are also silenced. Thus, N(6)-methyladenine developed a new role in epigenetic silencing in mammalian evolution distinct from its role in gene activation in other organisms. Our results demonstrate that N(6)-methyladenine constitutes a crucial component of the epigenetic regulation repertoire in mammalian genomes.},

abstract = {Sepiapterin reductase catalyses the last steps in the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin, the essential co-factor of aromatic amino acid hydroxylases and nitric oxide synthases. We have determined the crystal structure of mouse sepiapterin reductase by multiple isomorphous replacement at a resolution of 1.25 A in its ternary complex with oxaloacetate and NADP. The homodimeric structure reveals a single-domain alpha/beta-fold with a central four-helix bundle connecting two seven-stranded parallel beta-sheets, each sandwiched between two arrays of three helices. Ternary complexes with the substrate sepiapterin or the product tetrahydrobiopterin were studied. Each subunit contains a specific aspartate anchor (Asp258) for pterin-substrates, which positions the substrate side chain C1'-carbonyl group near Tyr171 OH and NADP C4'N. The catalytic mechanism of SR appears to consist of a NADPH-dependent proton transfer from Tyr171 to the substrate C1' and C2' carbonyl functions accompanied by stereospecific side chain isomerization. Complex structures with the inhibitor N-acetyl serotonin show the indoleamine bound such that both reductase and isomerase activity for pterins is inhibited, but reaction with a variety of carbonyl compounds is possible. The complex structure with N-acetyl serotonin suggests the possibility for a highly specific feedback regulatory mechanism between the formation of indoleamines and pteridines in vivo.},

@article{Powell1997,
abstract = {We first review what is known about patterns of codon usage bias in Drosophila and make the following points: (i) Drosophila genes are as biased or more biased than those in microorganisms. (ii) The level of bias of genes and even the particular pattern of codon bias can remain phylogenetically invariant for very long periods of evolution. (iii) However, some genes, even very tightly linked genes, can change very greatly in codon bias across species. (iv) Generally G and especially C are favored at synonymous sites in biased genes. (v) With the exception of aspartic acid, all amino acids contribute significantly and about equally to the codon usage bias of a gene. (vi) While most individual amino acids that can use G or C at synonymous sites display a preference for C, there are exceptions: valine and leucine, which prefer G. (vii) Finally, smaller genes tend to be more biased than longer genes. We then examine possible causes of these patterns and discount mutation bias on three bases: there is little evidence of regional mutation bias in Drosophila, mutation bias is likely toward A+T (the opposite of codon usage bias), and not all amino acids display the preference for the same nucleotide in the wobble position. Two lines of evidence support a selection hypothesis based on tRNA pools: highly biased genes tend to be highly and/or rapidly expressed, and the preferred codons in highly biased genes optimally bind the most abundant isoaccepting tRNAs. Finally, we examine the effect of bias on DNA evolution and confirm that genes with high codon usage bias have lower rates of synonymous substitution between species than do genes with low codon usage bias. Surprisingly, we find that genes with higher codon usage bias display higher levels of intraspecific synonymous polymorphism. This may be due to opposing effects of recombination.},

abstract = {N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) has been identified as the most abundant internal modification of messenger RNA in eukaryotes. m(6)A modification is involved in cell fate determination in yeast and embryo development in plants. Its mammalian function remains unknown but thousands of mammalian mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) show m(6)A modification and m(6)A demethylases are required for mammalian energy homeostasis and fertility. We identify two proteins, the putative m(6)A MTase, methyltransferase-like 3 (Mettl3; ref. ), and a related but uncharacterized protein Mettl14, that function synergistically to control m(6)A formation in mammalian cells. Knockdown of Mettl3 and Mettl14 in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) led to similar phenotypes, characterized by lack of m(6)A RNA methylation and lost self-renewal capability. A large number of transcripts, including many encoding developmental regulators, exhibit m(6)A methylation inversely correlated with mRNA stability and gene expression. The human antigen R (HuR) and microRNA pathways were linked to these effects. This gene regulatory mechanism operating in mESCs through m(6)A methylation is required to keep mESCs at their ground state and may be relevant to thousands of mRNAs and lncRNAs in various cell types.},

Many aberrant or differentially methylated sites have been discovered, but the mechanisms by which changes in DNA methylation lead to observed phenotypes, such as cancer, remain elusive. The classical view of methylation-mediated protein-DNA interactions is that only proteins with a methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) can interact with methylated DNA. However, evidence is emerging to suggest that transcription factors lacking a MBD can also interact with methylated DNA. The identification of these proteins and the elucidation of their characteristics and the biological consequences of methylation-dependent transcription factor-DNA interactions are important stepping stones towards a mechanistic understanding of methylation-mediated biological processes, which have crucial implications for human development and disease.},

Cloning and sequencing of PCR-amplified segments of the abnormally spliced transcripts showed that exons were joined accurately at consensus splice sites, but in an order different from that present in the primary transcript. Four scrambled transcripts were identified, each involving a different pair of exons. The scrambled transcripts were found at relatively low levels in a variety of normal and neoplastic cells of rodent and human origin, primarily in the nonpolyadenylated component of cytoplasmic RNA.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Many microorganisms, including myxobacteria, cyanobacteria, and flexibacteria, move by gliding. Although gliding always describes a slow surface-associated translocation in the direction of the cell's long axis, it can result from two very different propulsion mechanisms: social (S) motility and adventurous (A) motility. The force for S motility is generated by retraction of type 4 pili. A motility may be associated with the extrusion of slime, but evidence has been lacking, and how force might be generated has remained an enigma. Recently, nozzle-like structures were discovered in cyanobacteria from which slime emanated at the same rate at which the bacteria moved. This strongly implicates slime extrusion as a propulsion mechanism for gliding. RESULTS Here we show that similar but smaller nozzle-like structures are found in Myxococcus xanthus and that they are clustered at both cell poles, where one might expect propulsive organelles. Furthermore, light and electron microscopical observations show that slime is secreted in ribbons from the ends of cells. To test whether the slime propulsion hypothesis is physically reasonable, we construct a mathematical model of the slime nozzle to see if it can generate a force sufficient to propel M. xanthus at the observed velocities. The model assumes that the hydration of slime, a cationic polyelectrolyte, is the force-generating mechanism. CONCLUSIONS The discovery of nozzle-like organelles in various gliding bacteria suggests their role in prokaryotic gliding. Our calculations and our observations of slime trails demonstrate that slime extrusion from such nozzles can account for most of the observed properties of A motile gliding.},

abstract = {Autophagy, the process by which proteins and organelles are sequestered in autophagosomal vesicles and delivered to the lysosome/vacuole for degradation, provides a primary route for turnover of stable and defective cellular proteins. Defects in this system are linked with numerous human diseases. Although conserved protein kinase, lipid kinase and ubiquitin-like protein conjugation subnetworks controlling autophagosome formation and cargo recruitment have been defined, our understanding of the global organization of this system is limited. Here we report a proteomic analysis of the autophagy interaction network in human cells under conditions of ongoing (basal) autophagy, revealing a network of 751 interactions among 409 candidate interacting proteins with extensive connectivity among subnetworks. Many new autophagy interaction network components have roles in vesicle trafficking, protein or lipid phosphorylation and protein ubiquitination, and affect autophagosome number or flux when depleted by RNA interference. The six ATG8 orthologues in humans (MAP1LC3/GABARAP proteins) interact with a cohort of 67 proteins, with extensive binding partner overlap between family members, and frequent involvement of a conserved surface on ATG8 proteins known to interact with LC3-interacting regions in partner proteins. These studies provide a global view of the mammalian autophagy interaction landscape and a resource for mechanistic analysis of this critical protein homeostasis pathway.},

abstract = {All tissues of the organism are affected by aging. This process is associated with epigenetic modifications such as methylation changes at specific cytosine residues in the DNA (CpG sites). Here, we have identified an Epigenetic-Aging-Signature which is applicable for many tissues to predict donor age. DNA-methylation profiles of various cell types were retrieved from public data depositories - all using the HumanMethylation27 BeadChip platform which represents 27,578 CpG sites. Five datasets from dermis, epidermis, cervical smear, T-cells and monocytes were used for Pavlidis Template Matching to identify 19 CpG sites that are continuously hypermethylated upon aging (R{\textgreater}0.6; p-value{\textless}10-13). Four of these CpG sites (associated with the genes NPTX2, TRIM58, GRIA2 and KCNQ1DN) and an additional hypomethylated CpG site (BIRC4BP) were implemented in a model to predict donor age. This Epigenetic-Aging-Signature was tested on a validation group of eight independent datasets corresponding to several cell types from different tissues. Overall, the five CpG sites revealed age-associated DNA-methylation changes in all tissues. The average absolute difference between predicted and real chronological age was about 11 years. This method can be used to predict donor age in various cell preparations - for example in forensic analysis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Characterization of the epigenome is a primary interest for children's environmental health researchers studying the environmental influences on human populations, particularly those studying the role of pregnancy and early-life exposures on later-in-life health outcomes. OBJECTIVES Our objective was to consider the state of the science in environmental epigenetics research and to focus on DNA methylation and the collective observations of many studies being conducted within the Children's Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research Centers, as they relate to the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis. METHODS We address the current laboratory and statistical tools available for epigenetic analyses, discuss methods for validation and interpretation of findings, particularly when magnitudes of effect are small, question the functional relevance of findings, and discuss the future for environmental epigenetics research. DISCUSSION A common finding in environmental epigenetic studies is the small-magnitude epigenetic effect sizes that result from such exposures. Although it is reasonable and necessary that we question the relevance of such small effects, we present examples in which small effects persist and have been replicated across populations and across time. We encourage a critical discourse on the interpretation of such small changes and further research on their functional relevance for children's health. CONCLUSION The dynamic nature of the epigenome will require an emphasis on future longitudinal studies in which the epigenome is profiled over time, over changing environmental exposures, and over generations to better understand the multiple ways in which the epigenome may respond to environmental stimuli.},

abstract = {Two-component signal transduction systems enable bacteria to sense and respond to a wide range of environmental stimuli. Sensor histidine kinases transmit signals to their cognate response regulators via phosphorylation. The faithful transmission of information through two-component pathways and the avoidance of unwanted cross-talk require exquisite specificity of histidine kinase-response regulator interactions to ensure that cells mount the appropriate response to external signals. To identify putative specificity-determining residues, we have analyzed amino acid coevolution in two-component proteins and identified a set of residues that can be used to rationally rewire a model signaling pathway, EnvZ-OmpR. To explore how a relatively small set of residues can dictate partner selectivity, we combined alanine-scanning mutagenesis with an approach we call trajectory-scanning mutagenesis, in which all mutational intermediates between the specificity residues of EnvZ and another kinase, RstB, were systematically examined for phosphotransfer specificity. The same approach was used for the response regulators OmpR and RstA. Collectively, the results begin to reveal the molecular mechanism by which a small set of amino acids enables an individual kinase to discriminate amongst a large set of highly-related response regulators and vice versa. Our results also suggest that the mutational trajectories taken by two-component signaling proteins following gene or pathway duplication may be constrained and subject to differential selective pressures. Only some trajectories allow both the maintenance of phosphotransfer and the avoidance of unwanted cross-talk.},

abstract = {Peripheral quantitative computed tomography provides an automatical scan analysis of trabecular and cortical bone compartments, calculating not only their bone mineral density (BMD), but also bone geometrical parameters, such as marrow and cortical Cross-Sectional Area (CSA), Cortical Thickness (CoTh), both periosteal and endosteal circumference, as well as biomechanical parameters like Cross-Sectional Moment of Inertia (CSMI), a measure of bending, polar moment of inertia, indicating bone strength in torsion, and Strength Strain Index (SSI). Also CSA of muscle and fat can be extracted. Muscles, which are thought to stimulate bones to adapt their geometry and mineral content, are determinant to preserve or increase bone strength; thus, pQCT provides an evaluation of the functional 'muscle-bone unit', defined as BMC/muscle CSA ratio. This functional approach to bone densitometry can establish if bone strength is normally adapted to the muscle force, and if muscle force is adequate for body size, providing more detailed insights to targeted strategies for the prevention and treatment of bone fragility. The present paper offers an extensive review of technical features of pQCT and its possible clinical application in the diagnostic of bone status as well as in the monitoring of the skeleton's health follow-up.},

With the transition from a gene-centred to a genome-centred perspective, tRNAs and other RNA polymerase III transcripts surfaced as active regulators of normal cell physiology and disease. Novel strategies removing some of the hurdles that prevent quantitative tRNA profiling revealed that the differential exploitation of the tRNA pool critically affects the ability of the cell to balance protein homeostasis during normal and stress conditions. Furthermore, growing evidence indicates that the adaptation of tRNA synthesis to cellular dynamics can influence translation and mRNA stability to drive carcinogenesis and other pathological disorders. This review explores the contribution given by genomics, transcriptomics and epitranscriptomics to the discovery of emerging tRNA functions, and gives insights into some of the technical challenges that still limit our understanding of the RNA polymerase III transcriptional machinery.},

Objective: We assessed which maternal and environmental characteristics were associated with 25(OH)D after supplementation with cholecalciferol. Design: Within-randomization-group analysis of participants in the Maternal Vitamin D Osteo-porosis Study trial of vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy. Setting: Hospital antenatal clinics. Participants: A total of 829 pregnant women (422 placebo, 407 cholecalciferol). At 14 and 34 weeks of gestation, maternal anthropometry, health, and lifestyle were assessed and 25(OH)D measured. Compliance was determined using pill counts at 19 and 34 weeks. Interventions: 1000 IU/d of cholecalciferol or matched placebo from 14 weeks of gestation until delivery. Main Outcome Measure: 25(OH)D at 34 weeks, measured in a single batch (Diasorin Liaison). Results: 25(OH)D at 34 weeks of gestation was higher in the women randomized to vitamin D (mean [SD], 67.7 [21.3] nmol/L) compared with placebo (43.1 [22.5] nmol/L; P Ͻ .001). In women randomized to cholecalciferol, higher pregnancy weight gain from 14 to 34 weeks of gestation (kg) (␤ ϭ Ϫ0.81 [95{\%} confidence interval Ϫ1.39, Ϫ0.22]), lower compliance with study medication ({\%}) (␤ ϭ Ϫ0.28 [Ϫ0.072, Ϫ0.48]), lower early pregnancy 25(OH)D (nmol/L) (␤ ϭ 0.28 [0.16, 0.40]), and delivery in the winter vs the summer (␤ ϭ Ϫ10.5 [Ϫ6.4, Ϫ14.6]) were independently associated with lower 25(OH)D at 34 weeks of gestation. Conclusions: Women who gained more weight during pregnancy had lower 25(OH)D in early preg-nancy and delivered in winter achieved a lower 25(OH)D in late pregnancy when supplemented with 1000 IU/d cholecalciferol. Future studies should aim to determine appropriate doses to enable consis-tent repletion of 25(OH)D during pregnancy. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 101: 0000 – 0000, 2016)},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Cancers arise from multiple acquired mutations, which presumably occur over many years. Early stages in cancer development might be present years before cancers become clinically apparent. METHODS We analyzed data from whole-exome sequencing of DNA in peripheral-blood cells from 12,380 persons, unselected for cancer or hematologic phenotypes. We identified somatic mutations on the basis of unusual allelic fractions. We used data from Swedish national patient registers to follow health outcomes for 2 to 7 years after DNA sampling. RESULTS Clonal hematopoiesis with somatic mutations was observed in 10{\%} of persons older than 65 years of age but in only 1{\%} of those younger than 50 years of age. Detectable clonal expansions most frequently involved somatic mutations in three genes (DNMT3A, ASXL1, and TET2) that have previously been implicated in hematologic cancers. Clonal hematopoiesis was a strong risk factor for subsequent hematologic cancer (hazard ratio, 12.9; 95{\%} confidence interval, 5.8 to 28.7). Approximately 42{\%} of hematologic cancers in this cohort arose in persons who had clonality at the time of DNA sampling, more than 6 months before a first diagnosis of cancer. Analysis of bone marrow-biopsy specimens obtained from two patients at the time of diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia revealed that their cancers arose from the earlier clones. CONCLUSIONS Clonal hematopoiesis with somatic mutations is readily detected by means of DNA sequencing, is increasingly common as people age, and is associated with increased risks of hematologic cancer and death. A subset of the genes that are mutated in patients with myeloid cancers is frequently mutated in apparently healthy persons; these mutations may represent characteristic early events in the development of hematologic cancers.

abstract = {A common challenge in pathogen discovery by deep sequencing approaches is to recognize viral or subviral pathogens in samples of diseased tissue that share no significant homology with a known pathogen. Here we report a homology-independent approach for discovering viroids, a distinct class of free circular RNA subviral pathogens that encode no protein and are known to infect plants only. Our approach involves analyzing the sequences of the total small RNAs of the infected plants obtained by deep sequencing with a unique computational algorithm, progressive filtering of overlapping small RNAs (PFOR). Viroid infection triggers production of viroid-derived overlapping siRNAs that cover the entire genome with high densities. PFOR retains viroid-specific siRNAs for genome assembly by progressively eliminating nonoverlapping small RNAs and those that overlap but cannot be assembled into a direct repeat RNA, which is synthesized from circular or multimeric repeated-sequence templates during viroid replication. We show that viroids from the two known families are readily identified and their full-length sequences assembled by PFOR from small RNAs sequenced from infected plants. PFOR analysis of a grapevine library further identified a viroid-like circular RNA 375 nt long that shared no significant sequence homology with known molecules and encoded active hammerhead ribozymes in RNAs of both plus and minus polarities, which presumably self-cleave to release monomer from multimeric replicative intermediates. A potential application of the homology-independent approach for viroid discovery in plant and animal species where RNA replication triggers the biogenesis of siRNAs is discussed.},

The aim of this study was to examine heterogeneity of hip fracture probability in different regions from recent estimates of hip fracture incidence and mortality to adjust intervention thresholds. Ten-year probabilities of hip fracture were computed in men and women at 10-year intervals from the age of 50 years and lifetime risks at the age of 50 years from the hazard functions of hip fracture and death. Lifetime risk at the age of 50 years varied from 1{\%} in women from Turkey to 28.5{\%} in women from Sweden. High lifetime risks in women were associated with high lifetime risks in men (r = 0.83). There also were significant correlations of 10-year risk at any age between men and women. Ten-year probability was standardized to that of men and women from Sweden (set at 1.0). There was a 15-fold range in 10-year probability from 1.24 in Norway to 0.08 in Chile. Countries were categorized by 10-year probabilities comprising very high risk (Norway, Iceland, Sweden, Denmark, and the United States), high risk (China [Taiwan [TW)], Germany, Switzerland, Finland, Greece, Canada, The Netherlands, Hungary, Singapore, Italy, United Kingdom, Kuwait, Australia, and Portugal), medium risk (China [Hong Kong [HK)], France, Japan, Spain, Argentina, and China), and low risk (Turkey, Korea, Venezuela, and Chile). The categorization of hip fracture probabilities can be used to adjust intervention thresholds based on age, sex, and relative risk from a reference population such as Sweden.},

abstract = {We previously showed that the N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) mRNA methylase is essential during Arabidopsis thaliana embryonic development. We also demonstrated that this modification is present at varying levels in all mature tissues. However, the requirement for the m(6)A in the mature plant was not tested. Here we show that a 90{\%} reduction in m(6)A levels during later growth stages gives rise to plants with altered growth patterns and reduced apical dominance. The flowers of these plants commonly show defects in their floral organ number, size, and identity. The global analysis of gene expression from reduced m(6)A plants show that a significant number of down-regulated genes are involved in transport, or targeted transport, and most of the up-regulated genes are involved in stress and stimulus response processes. An analysis of m(6)A distribution in fragmented mRNA suggests that the m(6)A is predominantly positioned toward the 3' end of transcripts in a region 100-150 bp before the poly(A) tail. In addition to the analysis of the phenotypic changes in the low methylation Arabidopsis plants we will review the latest advances in the field of mRNA internal methylation.},

Its amazing ability to generate a highly visible, efficiently emitting internal fluorophore is both intrinsically fascinating and tremendously valuable. High-resolution crystal structures of GFP offer unprecedented opportunities to understand and manipulate the relation between protein structure and spectroscopic function. GFP has become well established as a marker of gene expression and protein targeting in intact cells and organisms. Mutagenesis and engineering of GFP into chimeric proteins are opening new vistas in physiological indicators, biosensors, and photochemical memories.},

abstract = {Myxococcus xanthus is a Gram-negative bacterium that glides over surfaces without the aid of flagella. Two motility systems are used for locomotion: social-motility, powered by the retraction of type IV pili, and adventurous (A)-motility, powered by unknown mechanism(s). We have shown that AgmU, an A-motility protein, is part of a multiprotein complex that spans the inner membrane and periplasm of M. xanthus. In this paper, we present evidence that periplasmic AgmU decorates a looped continuous helix that rotates clockwise as cells glide forward, reversing its rotation when cells reverse polarity. Inhibitor studies showed that the AgmU helix rotation is driven by proton motive force (PMF) and depends on actin-like MreB cytoskeletal filaments. The AgmU motility complex was found to interact with MotAB homologs. Our data are consistent with a mechanochemical model in which PMF-driven motors, similar to bacterial flagella stator complexes, run along an endless looped helical track, driving rotation of the track; deformation of the cell surface by the AgmU-associated proteins creates pressure waves in the slime, pushing cells forward.},

However, the mechanisms by which cyclic di-GMP regulates gene expression have remained a mystery. We found that cyclic di-GMP in many bacterial species is sensed by a riboswitch class in messenger RNA that controls the expression of genes involved in numerous fundamental cellular processes. A variety of cyclic di-GMP regulons are revealed, including some riboswitches associated with virulence gene expression, pilus formation, and flagellum biosynthesis. In addition, sequences matching the consensus for cyclic di-GMP riboswitches are present in the genome of a bacteriophage.},

The bacteria replicate within a specialized membrane-bound compartment termed the inclusion and require host-derived lipids for intracellular growth and development. Emerging evidence indicates that Chlamydia has evolved clever strategies to fulfil its lipid needs by interacting with multiple host cell compartments and redirecting trafficking pathways to its intracellular niche.

abstract = {The Y chromosome, a sex chromosome that only exists in males, has been ignored in traditional epigenetic association studies for multiple reasons. However, sex differences in aging-related phenotypes and mortality could suggest a critical role of the sex chromosomes in the aging process. We obtained blood-based DNA methylation data on the Y chromosome for 624 men from four cohorts and performed a chromosome-wide epigenetic association analysis to detect Y-linked CpGs differentially methylated over age and cross-validated the significant CpGs in the four cohorts. We identified 40–219 significant CpG sites (false discovery rate {\textless}0.05) with {\textgreater}82{\%} of them hypermethylated with increasing age, which is in strong contrast to the patterns reported on the autosomal chromosomes. Comparing the rate of change in the Y-linked DNA methylation across cohorts that represent different age intervals revealed a trend of acceleration in DNA methylation with increasing age. The age-dependent DNA methylation patterns on the Y chromosome were further examined for their association with all-cause mortality with results suggesting that the predominant pattern of age-related hypermethylation on the Y chromosome is associated with reduced risk of death.},

abstract = {Epitope-tagged active-site-directed probes are widely used to visualize the activity of deubiquitinases (DUBs) in cell extracts, to investigate the specificity and potency of small-molecule DUB inhibitors, and to isolate and identify DUBs by mass spectrometry. With DUBs arising as novel potential drug targets, probes are required that can be produced in sufficient amounts and to meet the specific needs of a given experiment. The established method for the generation of DUB probes makes use of labor-intensive intein-based methods that have inherent limitations concerning the incorporation of unnatural amino acids and the amount of material that can be obtained. Here, we describe the total chemical synthesis of active-site-directed probes and their application to activity-based profiling and identification of functional DUBs. This synthetic methodology allowed the easy incorporation of desired tags for specific applications, for example, fluorescent reporters, handles for immunoprecipitation or affinity pull-down, and cleavable linkers. Additionally, the synthetic method can be scaled up to provide significant amounts of probe. Fluorescent ubiquitin probes allowed faster, in-gel detection of active DUBs, as compared to (immuno)blotting procedures. A biotinylated probe holding a photocleavable linker enabled the affinity pull-down and subsequent mild, photorelease of DUBs. Also, DUB activity levels were monitored in response to overexpression or knockdown, and to inhibition by small molecules. Furthermore, fluorescent probes revealed differential DUB activity profiles in a panel of lung and prostate cancer cells.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Cancer of unknown primary ranks in the top ten cancer presentations and has an extremely poor prognosis. Identification of the primary tumour and development of a tailored site-specific therapy could improve the survival of these patients. We examined the feasability of using DNA methylation profiles to determine the occult original cancer in cases of cancer of unknown primary. METHODS We established a classifier of cancer type based on the microarray DNA methylation signatures (EPICUP) in a training set of 2790 tumour samples of known origin representing 38 tumour types and including 85 metastases. To validate the classifier, we used an independent set of 7691 known tumour samples from the same tumour types that included 534 metastases. We applied the developed diagnostic test to predict the tumour type of 216 well-characterised cases of cancer of unknown primary. We validated the accuracy of the predictions from the EPICUP assay using autopsy examination, follow-up for subsequent clinical detection of the primary sites months after the initial presentation, light microscopy, and comprehensive immunohistochemistry profiling. FINDINGS The tumour type classifier based on the DNA methylation profiles showed a 99{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} specificity (95{\%} CI 99{\textperiodcentered}5-99{\textperiodcentered}7), 97{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} sensitivity (96{\textperiodcentered}1-99{\textperiodcentered}2), 88{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} positive predictive value (85{\textperiodcentered}8-91{\textperiodcentered}3), and 99{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} negative predictive value (99{\textperiodcentered}9-100{\textperiodcentered}0) in the validation set of 7691 tumours. DNA methylation profiling predicted a primary cancer of origin in 188 (87{\%}) of 216 patients with cancer with unknown primary. Patients with EPICUP diagnoses who received a tumour type-specific therapy showed improved overall survival compared with that in patients who received empiric therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 3{\textperiodcentered}24, p=0{\textperiodcentered}0051 [95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}42-7{\textperiodcentered}38]; log-rank p=0{\textperiodcentered}0029). INTERPRETATION We show that the development of a DNA methylation based assay can significantly improve diagnoses of cancer of unknown primary and guide more precise therapies associated with better outcomes. Epigenetic profiling could be a useful approach to unmask the original primary tumour site of cancer of unknown primary cases and a step towards the improvement of the clinical management of these patients.

abstract = {New types of small RNAs distinct from microRNAs (miRNAs) are progressively being discovered in various organisms. In order to discover such novel small RNAs, a library of 17- to 26-base-long RNAs was created from prostate cancer cell lines and sequenced by ultra-high-throughput sequencing. A significant number of the sequences are derived from precise processing at the 5' or 3' end of mature or precursor tRNAs to form three series of tRFs (tRNA-derived RNA fragments): the tRF-5, tRF-3, and tRF-1 series. These sequences constitute a class of short RNAs that are second most abundant to miRNAs. Northern hybridization, quantitative RT-PCR, and splinted ligation assays independently measured the levels of at least 17 tRFs. To demonstrate the biological importance of tRFs, we further investigated tRF-1001, derived from the 3' end of a Ser-TGA tRNA precursor transcript that is not retained in the mature tRNA. tRF-1001 is expressed highly in a wide range of cancer cell lines but much less in tissues, and its expression in cell lines was tightly correlated with cell proliferation. siRNA-mediated knockdown of tRF-1001 impaired cell proliferation with the specific accumulation of cells in G2, phenotypes that were reversed specifically by cointroducing a synthetic 2'-O-methyl tRF-1001 oligoribonucleotide resistant to the siRNA. tRF-1001 is generated in the cytoplasm by tRNA 3'-endonuclease ELAC2, a prostate cancer susceptibility gene. Our data suggest that tRFs are not random by-products of tRNA degradation or biogenesis, but an abundant and novel class of short RNAs with precise sequence structure that have specific expression patterns and specific biological roles.},

abstract = {Estimates of biological age based on DNA methylation patterns, often referred to as "epigenetic age", "DNAm age", have been shown to be robust biomarkers of age in humans. We previously demonstrated that independent of chronological age, epigenetic age assessed in blood predicted all-cause mortality in four human cohorts. Here, we expanded our original observation to 13 different cohorts for a total sample size of 13,089 individuals, including three racial/ethnic groups. In addition, we examined whether incorporating information on blood cell composition into the epigenetic age metrics improves their predictive power for mortality. All considered measures of epigenetic age acceleration were predictive of mortality (p≤8.2x10-9), independent of chronological age, even after adjusting for additional risk factors (p{\textless}5.4x10-4), and within the racial/ethnic groups that we examined (non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics, African Americans). Epigenetic age estimates that incorporated information on blood cell composition led to the smallest p-values for time to death (p=7.5x10-43). Overall, this study a) strengthens the evidence that epigenetic age predicts all-cause mortality above and beyond chronological age and traditional risk factors, and b) demonstrates that epigenetic age estimates that incorporate information on blood cell counts lead to highly significant associations with all-cause mortality.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Methylation of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is an epigenetic regulator of gene expression that changes with age, but its contribution to aging-related disorders, including high blood pressure (BP), is still largely unknown. We examined the relation of BP to the methylation of retrotransposon sequences of DNA and of selected candidate genes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: This investigation included 789 elderly participants in the Normative Aging Study, ranging in age from 55 to 100 years, who had longitudinal measurements of DNA methylation. In these subjects' DNA we measured the proportion of methylated sites in retrotransposable sequences and in pro-inflammatory genes, expressed as the percent of 5-methylated cytosines ({\%}5mC) among all cytosines. From one to four methylation measurements were made for each subject between 1999 and 2009. We fit mixed-effects models, using repeated measures of BP as the outcome and DNA methylation as the explanatory variable, adjusting for confounding variables. We also fit a Bayesian mixed-effects structural equation model to account for heterogeneity in the effects of methylation sites within each gene.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: An increase in inter-quartile range (IQR) in the methylation of Alu elements was associated with an increase of 0.97 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (95{\%} CI 0.32-1.57), but no such association was observed for long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1). We also found positive associations between DBP and methylation of the genes for toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and a negative association between DBP and methylation of the gene for interferon-$\gamma$ (IFN-$\gamma$). Associations between methylation and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were weaker than those between methylation and DBP. Bayesian mixed-effects structural equation model results were similar for both DBP and SBP models.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest that changes in DNA methylation of some pro-inflammatory genes and retrotransposable elements are related to small changes in BP.},

abstract = {Increasing evidence suggests that tRNA levels are dynamically and specifically regulated in response to internal and external cues to modulate the cellular translational program. However, the molecular players and the mechanisms regulating the gene-specific expression of tRNAs are still unknown. Using an inducible auxin-degron system to rapidly deplete RPB1 (the largest subunit of RNA Pol II) in living cells, we identified Pol II as a direct gene-specific regulator of tRNA transcription. Our data suggest that Pol II transcription robustly interferes with Pol III function at specific tRNA genes. This activity was further found to be essential for MAF1-mediated repression of a large set of tRNA genes during serum starvation, indicating that repression of tRNA genes by Pol II is dynamically regulated. Hence, Pol II plays a direct and central role in the gene-specific regulation of tRNA expression.},

abstract = {DNA methylation is one of the most extensively studied epigenetic marks. It is involved in transcriptional gene silencing, it plays important roles during mammalian development and its perturbation is often associated with human diseases. In mammalian genomes, DNA methylation is a prevalent modification that decorates the majority of cytosines. It is found at the promoters and enhancers of inactive genes, at repetitive elements and within transcribed gene bodies. Its presence at promoters is dynamically linked to gene activity, suggesting that it could directly influence gene expression patterns and cellular identity. The genome-wide distribution and dynamic behaviour of this mark has been studied to great detail in a variety of tissues and cell lines, including early embryonic development and in embryonic stem cells. In combination with functional studies, these genome-wide maps of DNA methylation revealed interesting features of this mark and provided important insights into its dynamic nature and potential functional role in genome regulation. In this review we discuss how these recent observations, in combination with insights obtained from biochemical and functional genetics studies, have expanded our current knowledge about the regulation and context-dependent roles of DNA methylation in mammalian genomes.},

This paper examines published evidence on levels of PD and its public health consequences. Rates vary between studies from 0.8{\%} to 30{\%} (median 3.7{\%}, n = 17). Using information from genetic and behavioural studies, the article identifies those who conceive younger, live in deprivation, are in long term relationships (rather than marriages), or in certain cultural groups are at higher risk. Public health consequences of PD being exposed include family break up and violence. However, leaving PD undiagnosed means cases having incorrect information on their genetics and fathers continuing to suspect that children may not be theirs. Increasing paternity testing and use of DNA techniques in clinical and judicial procedures means more cases of PD will be identified. Given developing roles for individual's genetics in decisions made by health services, private services (for example, insurance), and even in personal lifestyle decisions, the dearth of intelligence on how and when PD should be exposed urgently needs addressing.},

@article{Blattler2014,
abstract = {BackgroundGene expression is epigenetically regulated by a combination of histone modifications and methylation of CpG dinucleotides in promoters. In normal cells, CpG-rich promoters are typically unmethylated, marked with histone modifications such as H3K4me3, and are highly active. During neoplastic transformation, CpG dinucleotides of CG-rich promoters become aberrantly methylated, corresponding with the removal of active histone modifications and transcriptional silencing. Outside of promoter regions, distal enhancers play a major role in the cell type specific regulation of gene expression. Enhancers, which function by bringing activating complexes to promoters through chromosomal looping, are also modulated by a combination of DNA methylation and histone modifications.ResultsHere we use HCT116 colorectal cancer cells with and without mutations in DNA methyltransferases, which results in a 95{\%} reduction in global DNA methylation levels. These cells are used to study the relationship between DNA methylation, histone modifications, and gene expression. We find that the loss of DNA methylation is not sufficient to reactivate most of the silenced promoters. In contrast, the removal of DNA methylation results in the activation of a large number of enhancer regions as determined by the acquisition of active histone marks.ConclusionsAlthough the transcriptome is largely unaffected by the loss of DNA methylation, we identify two distinct mechanisms resulting in the upregulation of distinct sets of genes. One is a direct result of DNA methylation loss at a set of promoter regions and the other is due to the presence of new intragenic enhancers.},

Lifestyle features concur with most evolutionary theories with the exception of the disposable soma theory. Indeed, maximum life span is similar in breeders and nonbreeders, and these highly fecund animals reproduce until they die. Shared characteristics with calorie-restricted, methionine-restricted, and dwarf mice models of extended longevity include reduced body temperature; reduced thyroid, and blood glucose concentrations; and low glycated hemoglobin; in addition to reduced incidence of cancer. Young naked mole-rats surprisingly have high levels of accrued oxidative damage. With their similar longevity quotient to humans, these rodents may provide a novel opportunity to examine mechanisms modulating aging.},

abstract = {Translational stop codon readthrough provides a regulatory mechanism of gene expression that is extensively utilised by positive-sense ssRNA viruses. The misreading of termination codons is achieved by a variety of naturally occurring suppressor tRNAs whose structure and function is the subject of this survey. All of the nonsense suppressors characterised to date (with the exception of selenocysteine tRNA) are normal cellular tRNAs that are primarily needed for reading their cognate sense codons. As a consequence, recognition of stop codons by natural suppressor tRNAs necessitates unconventional base pairings in anticodon-codon interactions. A number of intrinsic features of the suppressor tRNA contributes to the ability to read non-cognate codons. Apart from anticodon-codon affinity, the extent of base modifications within or 3' of the anticodon may up- or down-regulate the efficiency of suppression. In order to out-compete the polypeptide chain release factor an absolute prerequisite for the action of natural suppressor tRNAs is a suitable nucleotide context, preferentially at the 3' side of the suppressed stop codon. Three major types of viral readthrough sites, based on similar sequences neighbouring the leaky stop codon, can be defined. It is discussed that not only RNA viruses, but also the eukaryotic host organism might gain some profit from cellular suppressor tRNAs.},

abstract = {DNA methylation is assumed to be complementary on both alleles across the genome, although there are exceptions, notably in regions subject to genomic imprinting. We present a genome-wide survey of the degree of allelic skewing of DNA methylation with the aim of identifying previously unreported differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated primarily with genomic imprinting or DNA sequence variation acting in cis. We used SNP microarrays to quantitatively assess allele-specific DNA methylation (ASM) in amplicons covering 7.6{\%} of the human genome following cleavage with a cocktail of methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes (MSREs). Selected findings were verified using bisulfite-mapping and gene-expression analyses, subsequently tested in a second tissue from the same individuals, and replicated in DNA obtained from 30 parent-child trios. Our approach detected clear examples of ASM in the vicinity of known imprinted loci, highlighting the validity of the method. In total, 2,704 (1.5{\%}) of our 183,605 informative and stringently filtered SNPs demonstrate an average relative allele score (RAS) change {\textgreater} or =0.10 following MSRE digestion. In agreement with previous reports, the majority of ASM ( approximately 90{\%}) appears to be cis in nature, and several examples of tissue-specific ASM were identified. Our data show that ASM is a widespread phenomenon, with {\textgreater}35,000 such sites potentially occurring across the genome, and that a spectrum of ASM is likely, with heterogeneity between individuals and across tissues. These findings impact our understanding about the origin of individual phenotypic differences and have implications for genetic studies of complex disease.},

abstract = {The molecular details of the biogenesis of double-membraned autophagosomes are poorly understood. We identify the Saccharomyces cerevisiae AAA-adenosine triphosphatase Cdc48 and its substrate-recruiting cofactor Shp1/Ubx1 as novel components needed for autophagosome biogenesis. In mammals, the Cdc48 homologue p97/VCP and the Shp1 homologue p47 mediate Golgi reassembly by extracting an unknown monoubiquitinated fusion regulator from a complex. We find no requirement of ubiquitination or the proteasome system for autophagosome biogenesis but detect interaction of Shp1 with the ubiquitin-fold autophagy protein Atg8. Atg8 coupled to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is crucial for autophagosome elongation and, in vitro, mediates tethering and hemifusion. Interaction with Shp1 requires an FK motif within the N-terminal non-ubiquitin-like Atg8 domain. Based on our data, we speculate that autophagosome formation, in contrast to Golgi reassembly, requires a complex in which Atg8 functionally substitutes ubiquitin. This, for the first time, would give a rationale for use of the ubiquitin-like Atg8 during macroautophagy and would explain why Atg8-PE delipidation is necessary for efficient macroautophagy.},

While mTOR was already well known as a regulator of growth and protein translation, it is now clear that mTOR functions as a central coordinator of organismal metabolism in response to both environmental and hormonal signals. This review discusses recent developments in our understanding of how mTOR signaling is regulated by nutrients and the role of the mTOR signaling pathway in key metabolic tissues. Finally, we discuss the molecular basis for the negative metabolic side effects associated with rapamycin treatment, which may serve as barriers to the adoption of rapamycin or similar compounds for the treatment of diseases of aging and metabolism.},

abstract = {Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are abundant small non-coding RNAs that are crucially important for decoding genetic information. Besides fulfilling canonical roles as adaptor molecules during protein synthesis, tRNAs are also the source of a heterogeneous class of small RNAs, tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs). Occurrence and the relatively high abundance of tsRNAs has been noted in many high-throughput sequencing data sets, leading to largely correlative assumptions about their potential as biologically active entities. tRNAs are also the most modified RNAs in any cell type. Mutations in tRNA biogenesis factors including tRNA modification enzymes correlate with a variety of human disease syndromes. However, whether it is the lack of tRNAs or the activity of functionally relevant tsRNAs that are causative for human disease development remains to be elucidated. Here, we review the current knowledge in regard to tsRNAs biogenesis, including the impact of RNA modifications on tRNA stability and discuss the existing experimental evidence in support for the seemingly large functional spectrum being proposed for tsRNAs. We also argue that improved methodology allowing exact quantification and specific manipulation of tsRNAs will be necessary before developing these small RNAs into diagnostic biomarkers and when aiming to harness them for therapeutic purposes.},

abstract = {Metabolism is one of the attributes of life and supplies energy and building blocks to organisms. Therefore, understanding metabolism is crucial for the understanding of complex biological phenomena. Despite having been in the focus of research for centuries, our picture of metabolism is still incomplete. Metabolomics, the systematic analysis of all small molecules in a biological system, aims to close this gap. In order to facilitate such investigations a blue print of the metabolic network is required. Recently, several metabolic network reconstructions for the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans have been published, each having unique features. We have established the WormJam Community to merge and reconcile these (and other unpublished models) into a single consensus metabolic reconstruction. In a series of workshops and annotation seminars this model was refined with manual correction of incorrect assignments, metabolite structure and identifier curation as well as addition of new pathways. The WormJam consensus metabolic reconstruction represents a rich data source not only for in silico network-based approaches like flux balance analysis, but also for metabolomics, as it includes a database of metabolites present in C. elegans, which can be used for annotation. Here we present the process of model merging, correction and curation and give a detailed overview of the model. In the future it is intended to expand the model towards different tissues and put special emphasizes on lipid metabolism and secondary metabolism including ascaroside metabolism in accordance to their central role in C. elegans physiology.},

As such, the epigenome is an attractive candidate for mediating long-term responses to cellular stimuli, such as environmental effects modifying disease risk. Such epigenomic studies represent a broader category of disease -omics, which suffer from multiple problems in design and execution that severely limit their interpretability.

abstract = {The human genome consists of 625 tDNA copies that encode 51 distinct isoacceptor families. Recent studies demonstrated that changes in chromatin structure during cellular differentiation can alter the expression of these tDNA. However, the mechanism by which tDNA can be differentially regulated remains unclear. Here we used the directed differentiation of pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) towards the endoderm lineage as a model system to study the developmental regulation of individual tDNA. We demonstrated a significant change in the Pol III occupancy at 49 tDNA (22 reduced and 27 increased). The regulation of tDNA did not correlate with changes in TFIIIB or TFIIIC occupancy, H3K4me3, or H3K27me3 levels. However, tDNA that had an increase in Pol III binding were preferentially found within strong CTCF-COHESIN chromatin loops. The knockdown of either Ctcf or Rad21 in mouse tail tip fibroblasts had similar effects on changes in tRNA levels. We identified 7 isoacceptors that were differentially expressed during the directed differentiation of hESCs. The open reading frames of the ribosomal protein genes, which are translationally repressed during hESC differentiation, are enriched for codons that are decoded by these downregulated isoacceptors. Thus, translation efficiency during cellular differentiation may be affected by changes in tDNA regulation.},

We profiled 39 diverse primary tumors and 8 matched adjacent tissues using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and analyzed them alongside 343 additional human and 206 mouse WGBS datasets. We identified a local CpG sequence context associated with preferential hypomethylation in PMDs. Analysis of CpGs in this context (‘solo-WCGWs') identified previously undetected PMD hypomethylation in almost all healthy tissue types. PMD hypomethylation increased with age, beginning during fetal development, and appeared to track the accumulation of cell divisions. In cancer, PMD hypomethylation depth correlated with somatic mutation density and cell cycle gene expression, consistent with its reflection of mitotic history and suggesting its application as a mitotic clock. We propose that late replication leads to lifelong progressive methylation loss, which acts as a biomarker for cellular aging and which may contribute to oncogenesis.},

Recently, Hakai was also found to interact with PSF (PTB-associated splicing factor). While PSF can function as a DNA-binding protein with a tumor suppressive function, its association with Hakai promotes PSF's RNA-binding ability and post-transcriptional influence on target mRNAs. Hakai overexpression enhanced the binding of PSF to mRNAs encoding cancer-related proteins, while knockdown of Hakai reduced the RNA-binding ability of PSF. Furthermore, the knockdown of PSF suppressed Hakai-induced cell proliferation. Thus, Hakai can affect the oncogenic phenotype both by altering E-cadherin-based intercellular adhesions and by increasing PSF's ability to bind RNAs that promote cancer-related gene expression.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals. RESULTS We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package. AVAILABILITY http://maq.sourceforge.net.},

abstract = {The progressive restriction of differentiation potential from pluripotent embryonic stem cells, via multipotent progenitor cells to terminally differentiated, mature somatic cells, involves step-wise changes in transcription patterns that are tightly controlled by the coordinated action of key transcription factors and changes in epigenetic modifications. While previous studies have demonstrated tissue-specific differences in DNA methylation patterns that might function in lineage restriction, it is unclear at what exact developmental stage these differences arise. Here, we have studied whether terminal, multi-lineage differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts is accompanied by lineage-specific changes in DNA methylation patterns. Using bisulfite sequencing and genome-wide methylated DNA- and chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip techniques we show that in these cells, in general, myogenic genes are enriched for RNA polymerase II and hypomethylated, whereas osteogenic genes show lower polymerase occupancy and are hypermethylated. Removal of DNA methylation marks by 5-azacytidine (5AC) treatment alters the myogenic lineage commitment of these cells and induces spontaneous osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation. This is accompanied by upregulation of key lineage-specific transcription factors. We subsequently analyzed genome-wide changes in DNA methylation and polymerase II occupancy during BMP2-induced osteogenesis. Our data indicate that BMP2 is able to induce the transcriptional program underlying osteogenesis without changing the methylation status of the genome. We conclude that DNA methylation primes C2C12 cells for myogenesis and prevents spontaneous osteogenesis, but still permits induction of the osteogenic transcriptional program upon BMP2 stimulation. Based on these results, we propose that cell type-specific DNA methylation patterns are established prior to terminal differentiation of adult progenitor cells.

Fibrotic diseases are often associated with chronic pathologies and occur in a large variety of vital organs and tissues, including skeletal muscle. In human muscle, fibrosis is most readily associated with the severe muscle wasting disorder Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), caused by loss of dystrophin gene function. In DMD, skeletal muscle degenerates and is infiltrated by inflammatory cells and the functions of the muscle stem cells (satellite cells) become impeded and fibrogenic cells hyperproliferate and are overactivated, leading to the substitution of skeletal muscle with nonfunctional fibrotic tissue. Here, we review new developments in our understanding of the mechanisms leading to fibrosis in DMD and several recent advances towards reverting it, as potential treatments to attenuate disease progression.},

abstract = {Perfectly accurate translation of mRNA into protein is not a pre-requisite for life. Resulting from errors in protein synthesis, mistranslation occurs in all cells, including human cells. The human genome encodes {\textgreater}600 tRNA genes, providing both the raw material for genetic variation, and a buffer to ensure that resulting translation errors occur at tolerable levels. On the basis of data from the 1000 Genomes Project, we highlight the unanticipated prevalence of mistranslating tRNA variants in the human population and review studies on synthetic and natural tRNA mutations that cause mistranslation or de-regulate protein synthesis. Although mitochondrial tRNA variants are well known to drive human diseases, including developmental disorders, few studies have revealed a role for human cytoplasmic tRNA mutants in disease. In the context of the unexpectedly large number of tRNA variants in the human population, the emerging literature suggests that human diseases may be affected by natural tRNA variants that cause mistranslation or de-regulate tRNA expression and nucleotide modification. This review highlights examples relevant to genetic disorders, cancer, and neurodegeneration in which cytoplasmic tRNA variants directly cause or exacerbate disease and disease-linked phenotypes in cells, animal models, and humans. In the near future, tRNAs may be recognized as useful genetic markers to predict the onset or severity of human disease.},

abstract = {The yeast suppressor of myosin 2 protein (Smy2) interacts with mRNA-processing proteins through recognition of proline-rich sequences (PRS). Here, we describe the crystal structure of the GYF domain of Smy2 in association with a PRS from the yeast branch point binding protein (BBP/ScSF1). Complex formation requires that the beta-hairpin of the central PPGL motif of the ligand is accommodated by an extended hydrophobic cleft in the domain-a specificity feature that is maintained in the human protein GIGYF2. SILAC/MS experiments in combination with PRS site inhibition show that Smy2 associates with the Ccr4-NOT deadenylase complex, whereas GIGYF2 interacts not only with mRNA surveillance factors, but also with vesicular transport proteins and Atrophin-1. GIGYF2 is shown to associate with COPII-vesicle proteins and localize to the ER and Golgi in resting cells, whereas environmental challenge drives GIGYF2 into stress granules. The current study highlights the structural basis for PRS recognition by Smy2-type GYF domains, and implicates Smy2 and GIGYF2 in both mRNA processing and the secretory pathway.},

abstract = {Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) contain sequence diversity beyond their anticodons and the large variety of nucleotide modifications found in all kingdoms of life. Some modifications stabilize structure and fit in the ribosome whereas those to the anticodon loop modulate messenger RNA (mRNA) decoding activity more directly. The identities of tRNAs with some universal anticodon loop modifications vary among distant and parallel species, likely to accommodate fine tuning for their translation systems. This plasticity in positions 34 (wobble) and 37 is reflected in codon use bias. Here, we review convergent evidence that suggest that expansion of the eukaryotic tRNAome was supported by its dedicated RNA polymerase III transcription system and coupling to the precursor‐tRNA chaperone, La protein. We also review aspects of eukaryotic tRNAome evolution involving G34/A34 anticodon‐sparing, relation to A34 modification to inosine, biased codon use and regulatory information in the redundancy (synonymous) component of the genetic code. We then review interdependent anticodon loop modifications involving position 37 in eukaryotes. This includes the eukaryote‐specific tRNA modification, 3‐methylcytidine‐32 (m3C32) and the responsible gene, TRM140 and homologs which were duplicated and subspecialized for isoacceptor‐specific substrates and dependence on i6A37 or t6A37. The genetics of tRNA function is relevant to health directly and as disease modifiers.},

abstract = {Febrile neutropenia (FN) is a medical emergency and can represent a life-threatening complication for hematology patients treated with intensive chemotherapy regimens. In clinical practice, the diagnostic yield of blood cultures and other investigations which aim to identify a causative organism or site of infection is low. We have retrospectively examined all blood cultures collected in a "real world" cohort of patients receiving chemotherapy for acute leukemia and patients with aggressive lymphoma treated with Hyper-CVAD/MTX-cytarabine, at a single tertiary center over a five-year period. In this cohort, the 30-day mortality following confirmed blood stream infection (BSI) was 5.9{\%}, which is lower than most reports in the recent literature. We compared the blood culture results of inpatients undergoing induction chemotherapy and outpatients presenting with fevers and found a significantly higher rate of proven BSI in the outpatient group. In all settings, gram-negative organisms were most common. The rate of resistance to first-line empiric antibiotics among pathogenic isolates was 11.6{\%} in the whole cohort, independent of blood culture circumstances. There was a trend to higher resistance rates among inpatients undergoing induction chemotherapy compared to patients presenting to the emergency department (17.4{\%} vs 7.5{\%}) but this did not reach statistical significance. We also report low rates of ciprofloxacin resistance (5{\%} of isolates), in a center where universal fluoroquinolone prophylaxis is not employed. Our low resistance and mortality rates support our current therapeutic strategies, however presence of resistant organisms across the spectrum of indications for BC collection highlights the importance of surveilling local patterns, escalating antimicrobial therapy in the deteriorating patient, and considering advanced techniques for the rapid identification of resistance in this patient population.},

abstract = {Current generation DNA sequencing instruments are moving closer to seamlessly sequencing genomes of entire populations as a routine part of scientific investigation. However, while significant inroads have been made identifying small nucleotide variation and structural variations in DNA that impact phenotypes of interest, progress has not been as dramatic regarding epigenetic changes and base-level damage to DNA, largely due to technological limitations in assaying all known and unknown types of modifications at genome scale. Recently, single-molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing has been reported to identify kinetic variation (KV) events that have been demonstrated to reflect epigenetic changes of every known type, providing a path forward for detecting base modifications as a routine part of sequencing. However, to date no statistical framework has been proposed to enhance the power to detect these events while also controlling for false-positive events. By modeling enzyme kinetics in the neighborhood of an arbitrary location in a genomic region of interest as a conditional random field, we provide a statistical framework for incorporating kinetic information at a test position of interest as well as at neighboring sites that help enhance the power to detect KV events. The performance of this and related models is explored, with the best-performing model applied to plasmid DNA isolated from Escherichia coli and mitochondrial DNA isolated from human brain tissue. We highlight widespread kinetic variation events, some of which strongly associate with known modification events, while others represent putative chemically modified sites of unknown types.},

Furthermore, we have compared MSC from young and elderly donors. Overall, methylation patterns were maintained throughout both long-term culture and aging but highly significant differences were observed at specific CpG sites. Many of these differences were observed in homeobox genes and genes involved in cell differentiation. Methylation changes were verified by pyrosequencing after bisulfite conversion and compared to gene expression data. Notably, methylation changes in MSC were overlapping in long-term culture and aging in vivo. This supports the notion that replicative senescence and aging represent developmental processes that are regulated by specific epigenetic modifications.},

abstract = {Formation of the autophagosome is likely the most complex step of macroautophagy, and indeed it is the morphological and functional hallmark of this process; accordingly, it is critical to understand the corresponding molecular mechanism. Atg8 is the only known autophagy-related (Atg) protein required for autophagosome formation that remains associated with the completed sequestering vesicle. Approximately one-fourth of all of the characterized Atg proteins that participate in autophagosome biogenesis affect Atg8, regulating its conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), localization to the phagophore assembly site and/or subsequent deconjugation. An unanswered question in the field regards the physiological role of the deconjugation of Atg8-PE. Using an Atg8 mutant that bypasses the initial Atg4-dependent processing, we demonstrate that Atg8 deconjugation is an important step required to facilitate multiple events during macroautophagy. The inability to deconjugate Atg8-PE results in the mislocalization of this protein to the vacuolar membrane. We also show that the deconjugation of Atg8-PE is required for efficient autophagosome biogenesis, the assembly of Atg9-containing tubulovesicular clusters into phagophores/autophagosomes, and for the disassembly of PAS-associated Atg components.},

abstract = {Whole genome methylation profiling at a single cytosine resolution is now feasible due to the advent of high-throughput sequencing techniques together with bisulfite treatment of the DNA. To obtain the methylation value of each individual cytosine, the bisulfite-treated sequence reads are first aligned to a reference genome, and then the profiling of the methylation levels is done from the alignments. A huge effort has been made to quickly and correctly align the reads and many different algorithms and programs to do this have been created. However, the second step is just as crucial and non-trivial, but much less attention has been paid to the final inference of the methylation states. Important error sources do exist, such as sequencing errors, bisulfite failure, clonal reads, and single nucleotide variants. We developed MethylExtract, a user friendly tool to: i) generate high quality, whole genome methylation maps and ii) detect sequence variation within the same sample preparation. The program is implemented into a single script and takes into account all major error sources. MethylExtract detects variation (SNVs - Single Nucleotide Variants) in a similar way to VarScan, a very sensitive method extensively used in SNV and genotype calling based on non-bisulfite-treated reads. The usefulness of MethylExtract is shown by means of extensive benchmarking based on artificial bisulfite-treated reads and a comparison to a recently published method, called Bis-SNP. MethylExtract is able to detect SNVs within High-Throughput Sequencing experiments of bisulfite treated DNA at the same time as it generates high quality methylation maps. This simultaneous detection of DNA methylation and sequence variation is crucial for many downstream analyses, for example when deciphering the impact of SNVs on differential methylation. An exclusive feature of MethylExtract, in comparison with existing software, is the possibility to assess the bisulfite failure in a statistical way. The source code, tutorial and artificial bisulfite datasets are available at http://bioinfo2.ugr.es/MethylExtract/ and http://sourceforge.net/projects/methylextract/, and also permanently accessible from 10.5281/zenodo.7144.},

abstract = {Human CTC1-STN1-TEN1 (CST) is an RPA-like single-stranded DNA-binding protein that interacts with DNA polymerase $\alpha$-primase (pol $\alpha$) and functions in telomere replication. Previous studies suggest that CST also promotes replication restart after fork stalling. However, the precise role of CST in genome-wide replication remains unclear. In this study, we sought to understand whether CST alters origin licensing and activation. Replication origins are licensed by loading of the minichromosome maintenance 2–7 (MCM) complex in G1 followed by replisome assembly and origin firing in S-phase. We find that CST directly interacts with the MCM complex and disrupts binding of CDT1 to MCM, leading to decreased origin licensing. We also show that CST enhances replisome assembly by promoting AND-1/pol $\alpha$ chromatin association. Moreover, these interactions are not dependent on exogenous replication stress, suggesting that CST acts as a specialized replication factor during normal replication. Overall, our findings implicate CST as a novel regulator of origin licensing and replisome assembly/fork progression through interactions with MCM, AND-1, and pol $\alpha$.},

abstract = {DNA methylation is essential for development in the mouse and plays an important role in inactivation of the X-chromosome and genomic imprinting (Jaenisch, 1997). It may also contribute to immobilization of mam- malian transposons, suppression of transcriptional noise, and the control of tissue-specific gene expression, but decisive evidence on these points is lacking. The theme that iscommonto all thesephenomena is transcriptional repression.Work on animals, plants, and fungi nowleaves little doubt that gene silencing is a major biological con- sequence of DNA methylation (Colot and Rossignol, 1999). Methylation-mediated silencing also plays a part in both the etiology of human disease and attempts at therapeutic intervention. The methylation of tumor suppressor gene promoters contributes directly to pro- gression of some cancers (Jones and Laird, 1999), while the methylation of exogenous DNA introduced into cells compromises efforts at gene therapy (Garrick et al., 1998). To understand the DNA methylation system, we need to know how the methylation of CpG dinucleotides is targeted and maintained, how the methyl-CpG signal is read, andhowthis leads to repression of transcription. These questions are finally yielding to experimental scrutiny because several new protein players have been identified. Two years ago there was one mammalian DNA cytosine methyltransferase (DNMT1) and one gen- eralizedmethyl-CpG-binding protein (MeCP2). Now there are four mammalian DNMTs, five methyl-CpG-binding proteins and a candidate demethylase (see Figure 1). Two human genetic diseases have recently been attrib- uted to mutations in a methyl-CpG-binding protein (MeCP2; Amir et al., 1999) and the DNA methyltransfer- aseDNMT3b(Okano et al., 1999). This review will assess recent progress in understanding how some of these proteins bring about transcriptional repression.},

abstract = {DNA methylation plays a key role in regulating eukaryotic gene expression. Although mitotically heritable and stable over time, patterns of DNA methylation frequently change in response to cell differentiation, disease and environmental influences. Several methods have been developed to map DNA methylation on a genomic scale. Here, we benchmark four of these approaches by analyzing two human embryonic stem cell lines derived from genetically unrelated embryos and a matched pair of colon tumor and adjacent normal colon tissue obtained from the same donor. Our analysis reveals that methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq), methylated DNA capture by affinity purification (MethylCap-seq), reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and the Infinium HumanMethylation27 assay all produce accurate DNA methylation data. However, these methods differ in their ability to detect differentially methylated regions between pairs of samples. We highlight strengths and weaknesses of the four methods and give practical recommendations for the design of epigenomic case-control studies.},

abstract = {The mechanism of substrate loading in multisubunit RNA polymerase is crucial for understanding the general principles of transcription yet remains hotly debated. Here we report the 3.0-A resolution structures of the Thermus thermophilus elongation complex (EC) with a non-hydrolysable substrate analogue, adenosine-5'-[(alpha,beta)-methyleno]-triphosphate (AMPcPP), and with AMPcPP plus the inhibitor streptolydigin. In the EC/AMPcPP structure, the substrate binds to the active ('insertion') site closed through refolding of the trigger loop (TL) into two alpha-helices. In contrast, the EC/AMPcPP/streptolydigin structure reveals an inactive ('preinsertion') substrate configuration stabilized by streptolydigin-induced displacement of the TL. Our structural and biochemical data suggest that refolding of the TL is vital for catalysis and have three main implications. First, despite differences in the details, the two-step preinsertion/insertion mechanism of substrate loading may be universal for all RNA polymerases. Second, freezing of the preinsertion state is an attractive target for the design of novel antibiotics. Last, the TL emerges as a prominent target whose refolding can be modulated by regulatory factors.},

The key observation, supported by recent mutagenesis studies, is that these channels receive stretch force directly through the lipid bilayer at the interface levels bearing highest tension. Indeed, simulations of mechanosensitive channels steered by strategically applied bilayer stretch forces show channel opening. Our understanding of the gating energetics and trajectory are continually being refined by the combination of approaches applied. In addition, new microbial mechanosensitive channels from the TRP family have been characterized in yeasts. Unified by fundamental biophysical principles of gating, mechanosensitive channels provide broad insight into protein-membrane interactions and the role of hydrophobic hydration in gating.},

Telomere attrition and accumulation of mutations due to a progressive deficiency in the repair of DNA damage with age remain leading causes of genomic instability. However, epigenetic mechanisms have now emerged as key contributors to the alterations of genome structure and function that accompany aging. The three pillars of epigenetic regulation are DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding RNA species. Alterations of these epigenetic mechanisms affect the vast majority of nuclear processes, including gene transcription and silencing, DNA replication and repair, cell cycle progression, and telomere and centromere structure and function.

abstract = {Background: When designing an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to investigate the relationship between DNA methylation (DNAm) and some exposure(s) or phenotype(s), it is critically important to assess the sample size needed to detect a hypothesized difference with adequate statistical power. However, the complex and nuanced nature of DNAm data makes direct assessment of statistical power challenging. To circumvent these challenges and to address the outstanding need for a user-friendly interface for EWAS power evaluation, we have developed pwrEWAS. Results: The current implementation of pwrEWAS accommodates power estimation for two-group comparisons of DNAm (e.g. case vs control, exposed vs non-exposed, etc.), where methylation assessment is carried out using the Illumina Human Methylation BeadChip technology. Power is calculated using a semi-parametric simulation-based approach in which DNAm data is randomly generated from beta-distributions using CpG-specific means and variances estimated from one of several different existing DNAm data sets, chosen to cover the most common tissue-types used in EWAS. In addition to specifying the tissue type to be used for DNAm profiling, users are required to specify the sample size, number of differentially methylated CpGs, effect size(s) ($\Delta$ $\beta$ ), target false discovery rate (FDR) and the number of simulated data sets, and have the option of selecting from several different statistical methods to perform differential methylation analyses. pwrEWAS reports the marginal power, marginal type I error rate, marginal FDR, and false discovery cost (FDC). Here, we demonstrate how pwrEWAS can be applied in practice using a hypothetical EWAS. In addition, we report its computational efficiency across a variety of user settings. Conclusion: Both under- A nd overpowered studies unnecessarily deplete resources and even risk failure of a study. With pwrEWAS, we provide a user-friendly tool to help researchers circumvent these risks and to assist in the design and planning of EWAS. Availability: The web interface is written in the R statistical programming language using Shiny (RStudio Inc., 2016) and is available at https://biostats-shinyr.kumc.edu/pwrEWAS/. The R package for pwrEWAS is publicly available at GitHub (https://github.com/stefangraw/pwrEWAS).},

abstract = {For several decades the hydride transfer catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase has been difficult to understand. Here we add to the large corpus of anomalous and paradoxical data collected for this reaction by measuring a normal ({\textgreater} 1) 2 degrees kinetic isotope effect (KIE) for the reduction of benzaldehyde. Because the relevant equilibrium effect is inverse ({\textless} 1), this KIE eludes the traditional interpretation of 2 degrees KIEs. It does, however, enable the development of a comprehensive model for the "tunneling ready state" (TRS) of the reaction that fits into the general scheme of Marcus-like models of hydrogen tunneling. The TRS is the ensemble of states along the intricate reorganization coordinate, where H tunneling between the donor and acceptor occurs (the crossing point in Marcus theory). It is comparable to the effective transition state implied by ensemble-averaged variational transition state theory. Properties of the TRS are approximated as an average of the individual properties of the donor and acceptor states. The model is consistent with experimental findings that previously appeared contradictory; specifically, it resolves the long-standing ambiguity regarding the location of the TRS (aldehyde-like vs. alcohol-like). The new picture of the TRS for this reaction identifies the principal components of the collective reaction coordinate and the average structure of the saddle point along that coordinate.},

abstract = {Evolutionary modification has produced a spectrum of animal defence traits to escape predation, including the ability to autotomize body parts to elude capture. After autotomy, the missing part is either replaced through regeneration (for example, in urodeles, lizards, arthropods and crustaceans) or permanently lost (such as in mammals). Although most autotomy involves the loss of appendages (legs, chelipeds, antennae or tails, for example), skin autotomy can occur in certain taxa of scincid and gekkonid lizards. Here we report the first demonstration of skin autotomy in Mammalia (African spiny mice, Acomys). Mechanical testing showed a propensity for skin to tear under very low tension and the absence of a fracture plane. After skin loss, rapid wound contraction was followed by hair follicle regeneration in dorsal skin wounds. Notably, we found that regenerative capacity in Acomys was extended to ear holes, where the mice exhibited complete regeneration of hair follicles, sebaceous glands, dermis and cartilage. Salamanders capable of limb regeneration form a blastema (a mass of lineage-restricted progenitor cells) after limb loss, and our findings suggest that ear tissue regeneration in Acomys may proceed through the assembly of a similar structure. This study underscores the importance of investigating regenerative phenomena outside of conventional model organisms, and suggests that mammals may retain a higher capacity for regeneration than was previously believed. As re-emergent interest in regenerative medicine seeks to isolate molecular pathways controlling tissue regeneration in mammals, Acomys may prove useful in identifying mechanisms to promote regeneration in lieu of fibrosis and scarring.},

abstract = {The methylation of internal adenosine residues in eukaryotic mRNA, forming N6-methyladenosine (m6A), is catalyzed by a complex multicomponent enzyme. Previous studies suggested that m6A affects the efficiency of mRNA processing or transport, although the mechanism by which this occurs is not known. As a step toward better understanding the mechanism and function of this ubiquitous posttranscriptional modification, we have shown that HeLa mRNA (N6-adenosine)-methyltransferase requires at least two separate protein factors, MT-A and MT-B, and MT-A contains the AdoMet binding site on a 70-kDa subunit (MT-A70). MT-A70 was purified by conventional chromatography and electrophoresis, and was microsequenced. The peptide sequence was used to design a degenerate oligodeoxynucleotide that in turn was used to isolate the cDNA clone coding for MT-A70 from a HeLa cDNA library. Recombinant MT-A70 was expressed as a fusion protein in bacteria and was used to generate anti-MT-A70 antisera in rabbits. These antisera recognize MT-A70 in HeLa nuclear extracts by western blot and are capable of depleting (N6-adenosine)-methyltransferase activity from HeLa nuclear extract, confirming that MT-A70 is a critical subunit of (N6-adenosine)-methyltransferase. Northern blot analysis reveals that MT-A70 mRNA is present in a wide variety of human tissues and may undergo alternative splicing. MT-A70 cDNA probe hybridizes to a 2.0-kilobase (kb) polyadenylated RNA isolated from HeLa cells, whereas it hybridizes to two predominant RNA species (approximately 2.0 kb and 3.0 kb) using mRNA isolated from six different human tissues. Analysis of the cDNA sequence indicates that it codes for a 580-amino acid protein with a predicted MW = 65 kDa. The predicted protein contains sequences similar to consensus methylation motifs I and II identified in prokaryotic DNA (N6-adenosine)-methyltransferases, suggesting the functional conservation of peptide motifs. MT-A70 also contains a long region of homology to the yeast protein SPO8, which is involved in induction of sporulation by an unknown mechanism.},

Replicative senescence is a tumour suppressor process that imposes a limit on the proliferative potential of normal cells that all cancer cells must bypass. Here we show by whole-genome single-nucleotide bisulfite sequencing that replicative senescent human cells exhibit widespread DNA hypomethylation and focal hypermethylation. Hypomethylation occurs preferentially at gene-poor, late-replicating, lamin-associated domains and is linked to mislocalization of the maintenance DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) in cells approaching senescence. Low-level gains of methylation are enriched in CpG islands, including at genes whose methylation and silencing is thought to promote cancer. Gains and losses of methylation in replicative senescence are thus qualitatively similar to those in cancer, and this 'reprogrammed' methylation landscape is largely retained when cells bypass senescence. Consequently, the DNA methylome of senescent cells might promote malignancy, if these cells escape the proliferative barrier.},

abstract = {In recent years, an enormous progress has been made in applied genomics leading to identification and isolation of novel cDNAs. However, most attempts result in the acquisition of transcribed sequences that represent only a part of the mRNA's complete sequence. Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) is a technique used in molecular biology to obtain the full length sequence of an RNA transcript found within a cell. Since the first report of this technique, many significant improvements have been made on the basic approach. This chapter describes the most recent update of the relatively simple and versatile classic RACE protocol.},

abstract = {Polycomb group proteins (PCGs) are involved in repression of genes that are required for stem cell differentiation. Recently, it was shown that promoters of PCG target genes (PCGTs) are 12-fold more likely to be methylated in cancer than non-PCGTs. Age is the most important demographic risk factor for cancer, and we hypothesized that its carcinogenic potential may be referred by irreversibly stabilizing stem cell features. To test this, we analyzed the methylation status of over 27,000 CpGs mapping to promoters of approximately 14,000 genes in whole blood samples from 261 postmenopausal women. We demonstrate that stem cell PCGTs are far more likely to become methylated with age than non-targets (odds ratio = 5.3 [3.8-7.4], P {\textless} 10(-10)), independently of sex, tissue type, disease state, and methylation platform. We identified a specific subset of 69 PCGT CpGs that undergo hypermethylation with age and validated this methylation signature in seven independent data sets encompassing over 900 samples, including normal and cancer solid tissues and a population of bone marrow mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (P {\textless} 10(-5)). We find that the age-PCGT methylation signature is present in preneoplastic conditions and may drive gene expression changes associated with carcinogenesis. These findings shed substantial novel insights into the epigenetic effects of aging and support the view that age may predispose to malignant transformation by irreversibly stabilizing stem cell features.},

Here, we report the 3.5-angstrom cryo–electron microscopy structures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNase P alone and in complex with pre-tRNA Phe . The protein components form a hook-shaped architecture that wraps around the RNA and stabilizes RNase P into a “measuring device” with two fixed anchors that recognize the L-shaped pre-tRNA. A universally conserved uridine nucleobase and phosphate backbone in the catalytic center together with the scissile phosphate and the O3′ leaving group of pre-tRNA jointly coordinate two catalytic magnesium ions. Binding of pre-tRNA induces a conformational change in the catalytic center that is required for catalysis. Moreover, simulation analysis suggests a two-metal-ion S N 2 reaction pathway of pre-tRNA cleavage. These results not only reveal the architecture of yeast RNase P but also provide a molecular basis of how the 5′-leader of pre-tRNA is processed by eukaryotic RNase P.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a poorly characterized class of molecules that have been identified decades ago. Emerging high-throughput sequencing methods as well as first reports on confirmed functions have sparked new interest in this RNA species. However, the computational detection and quantification tools are still limited. RESULTS We developed the software tandem, DCC and CircTest DCC uses output from the STAR read mapper to systematically detect back-splice junctions in next-generation sequencing data. DCC applies a series of filters and integrates data across replicate sets to arrive at a precise list of circRNA candidates. We assessed the detection performance of DCC on a newly generated mouse brain data set and publicly available sequencing data. Our software achieves a much higher precision than state-of-the-art competitors at similar sensitivity levels. Moreover, DCC estimates circRNA versus host gene expression from counting junction and non-junction reads. These read counts are finally used to test for host gene-independence of circRNA expression across different experimental conditions by our R package CircTest We demonstrate the benefits of this approach on previously reported age-dependent circRNAs in the fruit fly.

abstract = {Formation of the Escherichia coli division septum is catalyzed by a number of essential proteins (named Fts) that assemble into a ring-like structure at the future division site. Several of these Fts proteins are intrinsic transmembrane proteins whose functions are largely unknown. Although these proteins appear to be recruited to the division site in a hierarchical order, the molecular interactions underlying the assembly of the cell division machinery remain mostly unspecified. In the present study, we used a bacterial two-hybrid system based on interaction-mediated reconstitution of a cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling cascade to unravel the molecular basis of septum assembly by analyzing the protein interaction network among E. coli cell division proteins. Our results indicate that the Fts proteins are connected to one another through multiple interactions. A deletion mapping analysis carried out with two of these proteins, FtsQ and FtsI, revealed that different regions of the polypeptides are involved in their associations with their partners. Furthermore, we showed that the association between two Fts hybrid proteins could be modulated by the coexpression of a third Fts partner. Altogether, these data suggest that the cell division machinery assembly is driven by the cooperative association among the different Fts proteins to form a dynamic multiprotein structure at the septum site. In addition, our study shows that the cAMP-based two-hybrid system is particularly appropriate for analyzing molecular interactions between membrane proteins.},

abstract = {Insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling (IIS) is a critical regulator of an organism's most important biological decisions from growth, development, and metabolism to reproduction and longevity. It primarily does so through the activity of the DAF-16 transcription factor (forkhead box O (FOXO) homologue), whose global targets were identified in Caenorhabditis elegans using whole-worm transcriptional analyses more than a decade ago. IIS and FOXO also regulate important neuronal and adult behavioural phenotypes, such as the maintenance of memory and axon regeneration with age, in both mammals and C. elegans, but the neuron-specific IIS/FOXO targets that regulate these functions are still unknown. By isolating adult C. elegans neurons for transcriptional profiling, we identified both the wild-type and IIS/FOXO mutant adult neuronal transcriptomes for the first time. IIS/FOXO neuron-specific targets are distinct from canonical IIS/FOXO-regulated longevity and metabolism targets, and are required for extended memory in IIS daf-2 mutants. The activity of the forkhead transcription factor FKH-9 in neurons is required for the ability of daf-2 mutants to regenerate axons with age, and its activity in non-neuronal tissues is required for the long lifespan of daf-2 mutants. Together, neuron-specific and canonical IIS/FOXO-regulated targets enable the coordinated extension of neuronal activities, metabolism, and longevity under low-insulin signalling conditions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Modification of DNA by methylation of cytosines at CpG dinucleotides is a widespread phenomenon that leads to changes in gene expression, thereby influencing and regulating many biological processes. Recent technical advances in the genome-wide determination of single-base DNA-methylation enabled epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs). Early EWASs established robust associations between age and gender with the degree of CpG methylation at specific sites. Other studies uncovered associations with cigarette smoking. However, so far these studies were mainly conducted in Caucasians, raising the question of whether these findings can also be extrapolated to other populations. RESULTS Here, we present an EWAS with age, gender, and smoking status in a family study of 123 individuals of Arab descent. We determined DNA methylation at over 450,000 CpG sites using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, applied state-of-the-art data processing protocols, including correction for blood cell type heterogeneity and hidden confounders, and eliminated probes containing SNPs at the targeted CpG site using 40× whole-genome sequencing data. Using this approach, we could replicate the leading published EWAS associations with age, gender and smoking, and recovered hallmarks of gender-specific epigenetic changes. Interestingly, we could even replicate the recently reported precise prediction of chronological age based on the methylation of only a few selected CpG sites. CONCLUSION Our study supports the view that when applied with state-of-the art protocols to account for all potential confounders, DNA methylation arrays represent powerful tools for EWAS with more complex phenotypes that can also be successfully applied to non-Caucasian populations.},

IN catalyzes processing of the ends of a DNA copy of the retroviral genome and its concerted insertion into the chromosome of the host cell. The protein consists of three domains, the central catalytic core domain flanked by the N-terminal and C-terminal domains, the latter being involved in DNA binding. Although the Protein Data Bank contains a number of NMR structures of the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of HIV-1 and HIV-2, simian immunodeficiency virus and avian sarcoma virus IN, as well as X-ray structures of the core domain of HIV-1, avian sarcoma virus and foamy virus IN, plus several models of two-domain constructs, no structure of the complete molecule of retroviral IN has been solved to date. Although no experimental structures of IN complexed with the DNA substrates are at hand, the catalytic mechanism of IN is well understood by analogy with other nucleotidyl transferases, and a variety of models of the oligomeric integration complexes have been proposed. In this review, we present the current state of knowledge resulting from structural studies of IN from several retroviruses. We also attempt to reconcile the differences between the reported structures, and discuss the relationship between the structure and function of this enzyme, which is an important, although so far rather poorly exploited, target for designing drugs against HIV-1 infection.},

abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) populations change with aging, but the extent to which this is caused by qualitative versus quantitative alterations in HSC subtypes is unclear. Using clonal assays, in this study we show that the aging HSC compartment undergoes both quantitative and qualitative changes. We observed a variable increase of HSC pool size with age, accompanied by the accumulation of predominantly myeloid-biased HSCs that regenerate substantially fewer mature progeny than young myeloid-biased HSCs and exhibit reduced self-renewal activity as measured by long-term secondary transplantation. Old HSCs had a twofold reduction in marrow-homing efficiency and a similar decrease in functional frequency as measured using long-term transplantation assays. Similarly, old HSCs had a twofold reduced seeding efficiency and a significantly delayed proliferative response compared with young HSCs in long-term stromal cell co-cultures but were indistinguishable in suspension cultures. We show that these functional defects are characteristics of most or all old HSCs and are not indicative of a nonfunctional subset of cells that express HSC markers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cells with functional properties of old HSCs can be generated directly from young HSCs by extended serial transplantation, which is consistent with the possibility that they arise through a process of cellular aging.},

Trends in the RO5 literature explosion that can be discerned are the further definitions of drug-like. This topic is explored in terms of drug-like physicochemical features, drug-like structural features, a comparison of drug-like and non-drug-like in drug discovery and a discussion of how drug-like features relate to clinical success. Physicochemical features of CNS drugs and features related to CNS blood-brain transporter affinity are briefly reviewed. Recent literature on features of non-oral drugs is reviewed and how features of lead-like compounds differ from those of drug-like compounds is discussed. Most recently, partly driven by NIH roadmap initiatives, considerations have arisen as to what tool-like means in the search for chemical tools to probe biology space. All these topics frame the scope of this short review/perspective. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Especially, archaeal and eukaryotic genomes are good sources of tRNA introns that are removed by proteinaceous splicing machinery. Most intron-containing tRNA genes both in archaea and eukaryotes possess an intron at a so-called canonical position, one nucleotide 3' to their anticodon, while recent bioinformatics have revealed unusual types of tRNA introns and their derivatives especially in archaeal genomes. Gain and loss of tRNA introns during various stages of evolution are obvious both in archaea and eukaryotes from analyses of comparative genomics. The splicing of tRNA molecules has been studied extensively from biochemical and cell biological points of view, and such analyses of eukaryotic systems provided interesting findings in the past years. Here, I summarize recent progresses in the analyses of tRNA introns and the splicing process, and try to clarify new and old questions to be solved in the next stages.},

abstract = {Abundant evidence shows that the genome is not as static as once thought and that gene expression can be reversibly modulated by the environment. In some cases, these changes can be transmitted to the next generation even if the environment has reverted. Such transgenerational epigenetic inheritance requires that information be stored in the germline in response to exogenous stressors. One of the most elusive questions in the field of epigenetic inheritance is the identity of such inherited factor(s). Answering this question would allow us to understand how the environment can shape human populations for multiple generations and may help to explain the rapid rise in obesity and neurodegenerative diseases in modern society. It will also provide clues on how we might be able to reprogramme the epigenome to prevent transmission of detrimental phenotypes and identify individuals who might be at increased risk of disease. In this article, we aim to review recent developments in this field, focusing on research conducted mostly in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and mice, that link environmental modulators with the transgenerational inheritance of phenotypes that affect protein-folding homoeostasis and ageing.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Mammalian species exhibit a wide range of lifespans. To date, a robust and dynamic molecular readout of these lifespan differences has not yet been identified. Recent studies have established the existence of ageing-associated differentially methylated positions (aDMPs) in human and mouse. These are CpG sites at which DNA methylation dynamics show significant correlations with age. We hypothesise that aDMPs are pan-mammalian and are a dynamic molecular readout of lifespan variation among different mammalian species. RESULTS A large-scale integrated analysis of aDMPs in six different mammals reveals a strong negative relationship between rate of change of methylation levels at aDMPs and lifespan. This relationship also holds when comparing two different dog breeds with known differences in lifespans. In an ageing cohort of aneuploid mice carrying a complete copy of human chromosome 21, aDMPs accumulate far more rapidly than is seen in human tissues, revealing that DNA methylation at aDMP sites is largely shaped by the nuclear trans-environment and represents a robust molecular readout of the ageing cellular milieu. CONCLUSIONS Overall, we define the first dynamic molecular readout of lifespan differences among mammalian species and propose that aDMPs will be an invaluable molecular tool for future evolutionary and mechanistic studies aimed at understanding the biological factors that determine lifespan in mammals.},

abstract = {Mouse primordial germ cells (PGCs) undergo sequential epigenetic changes and genome-wide DNA demethylation to reset the epigenome for totipotency. Here, we demonstrate that erasure of CpG methylation (5mC) in PGCs occurs via conversion to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), driven by high levels of TET1 and TET2. Global conversion to 5hmC initiates asynchronously among PGCs at embryonic day (E) 9.5 to E10.5 and accounts for the unique process of imprint erasure. Mechanistically, 5hmC enrichment is followed by its protracted decline thereafter at a rate consistent with replication-coupled dilution. The conversion to 5hmC is an important component of parallel redundant systems that drive comprehensive reprogramming in PGCs. Nonetheless, we identify rare regulatory elements that escape systematic DNA demethylation in PGCs, providing a potential mechanistic basis for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.},

abstract = {Respiratory properties of whole blood and Hb solutions have been studied in Heterocephalus glaber, a fossorial rodent, having a low body temperature (30.0–32.0 C) and poor thermoregulatory ability. For comparison similar, measurements were made on laboratory mice. Mus musculus. Whole blood showed a distinctly higher O2 affinity for Heterocephalus at both 30 and 37°C. P50 values were 23.3 mm Hg and 33.0mm H gat 37°C for Heterocephalus and Mus, respectively, while at 30°C P50's were 18.8mm Hg and 24.9 mm Hg, all values at pH (b) 7.4. $\Delta$H values (expressive of the effect of temperature on P50) were −5.8 kcal {\textperiodcentered} mol−1 for Heterocephalus and −7.5 kcal {\textperiodcentered} mol−1 for Mus. The CO2 Bohr effects ($\phi$) were −0.43 and −0.50 for Heterocephalus at 37 and 30°C. Corresponding values for Mus were −0.65 and −0.56. Both species had a Hill's n-value of 2.6. Red cell concentrations of 2,3-DGP were closely similar in the species being 7.3 mmol {\textperiodcentered} L− rbc for Heterocephalus and 7.4 mmol {\textperiodcentered} L− rbe for Mus. Stripped Heterocephalus Hb had a very high O2 affinity, at pH 7.25. 37°C, P50 was 8.0 mm Hg whereas the corresponding value for Mus was 11.3 mm Hg. Addition of DPG to stripped Hb from the two species decreased O2 affinity to the same degree. The high 02 affinity of Heterocephalus blood is viewed as a possible adaptation to its burrowing habits. Its basis is inherent to the hemoglobin molecule itself and not dependent upon cofactor influence or the temperature sensitivity of the O2-Hb binding.},

To explore these mechanisms further, we generated catalogs of somatic mutation from 21 breast cancers and applied mathematical methods to extract mutational signatures of the underlying processes. Multiple distinct single- and double-nucleotide substitution signatures were discernible. Cancers with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations exhibited a characteristic combination of substitution mutation signatures and a distinctive profile of deletions. Complex relationships between somatic mutation prevalence and transcription were detected. A remarkable phenomenon of localized hypermutation, termed "kataegis," was observed. Regions of kataegis differed between cancers but usually colocalized with somatic rearrangements. Base substitutions in these regions were almost exclusively of cytosine at TpC dinucleotides. The mechanisms underlying most of these mutational signatures are unknown. However, a role for the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases is proposed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Sj{\"{o}}gren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by ichthyosis, mental retardation, spasticity, and deficient activity of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH). To define the molecular defects causing SLS, we performed mutation analysis of the FALDH gene in probands from 63 kindreds with SLS. Among these patients, 49 different mutations—including 10 deletions, 2 insertions, 22 amino acid substitutions, 3 nonsense mutations, 9 splice-site defects, and 3 complex mutations—were found. All of the patients with SLS were found to carry mutations. Nineteen of the missense mutations resulted in a severe reduction of FALDH enzyme catalytic activity when expressed in mammalian cells, but one mutation (798G→C [K266N]) seemed to have a greater effect on mRNA stability. The splice-site mutations led to exon skipping or utilization of cryptic acceptor-splice sites. Thirty-seven mutations were private, and 12 mutations were seen in two or more probands of European or Middle Eastern descent. Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found in the FALDH gene. At least four of the common mutations (551C→T, 682C→T, 733G→A, and 798+1delG) were associated with multiple SNP haplotypes, suggesting that these mutations originated independently on more than one occasion or were ancient SLS genes that had undergone intragenic recombination. Our results demonstrate that SLS is caused by a strikingly heterogeneous group of mutations in the FALDH gene and provide a framework for understanding the genetic basis of SLS and the development of DNA-based diagnostic tests.},

abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs), an abundant class of noncoding RNAs in higher eukaryotes, are generated from pre-mRNAs by circularization of adjacent exons. Using a set of 15 circRNAs, we demonstrated their cell-type-specific expression and circular versus linear processing in mammalian cells. Northern blot analysis combined with RNase H cleavage conclusively proved a circular configuration for two examples, LPAR1 and HIPK3. To address the circularization mechanism, we analyzed the sequence requirements using minigenes derived from natural circRNAs. Both canonical splice sites are required for circularization, although they vary in flexibility and potential use of cryptic sites. Surprisingly, we found that no specific circRNA exon sequence is necessary and that potential flanking intron structures can modulate circularization efficiency. In combination with splice inhibitor assays, our results argue that the canonical spliceosomal machinery functions in circRNA biogenesis, constituting an alternative splicing mode.},

abstract = {The concept of phenoptosis (or programmed organismal death) is problematic with respect to most species (including humans) since it implies that dying of old age is an adaptation, which contradicts the established evolutionary theory. But can dying ever be a strategy to promote fitness? Given recent developments in our understanding of the evolution of altruism, particularly kin and multilevel selection theories, it is timely to revisit the possible existence of adaptive death. Here, we discuss how programmed death could be an adaptive trait under certain conditions found in organisms capable of clonal colonial existence, such as the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and, perhaps, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The concept of phenoptosis is only tenable if consistent with the evolutionary theory; this accepted, phenoptosis may only occur under special conditions that do not apply to most animal groups (including mammals).},

abstract = {Cytosine methylation is a repressive, epigenetically propagated DNA modification. Although patterns of DNA methylation seem tightly regulated in mammals, it is unclear how these are specified and to what extent this process entails genetic or epigenetic regulation. To dissect the role of the underlying DNA sequence, we sequentially inserted over 50 different DNA elements into the same genomic locus in mouse stem cells. Promoter sequences of approximately 1,000 bp autonomously recapitulated correct DNA methylation in pluripotent cells. Moreover, they supported proper de novo methylation during differentiation. Truncation analysis revealed that this regulatory potential is contained within small methylation-determining regions (MDRs). MDRs can mediate both hypomethylation and de novo methylation in cis, and their activity depends on developmental state, motifs for DNA-binding factors and a critical CpG density. These results demonstrate that proximal sequence elements are both necessary and sufficient for regulating DNA methylation and reveal basic constraints of this regulation.},

Epigenetic markers, like any other molecular biomarker, are vulnerable to confounding and reverse causation. Here, we present a strategy, based on the well-established framework of Mendelian randomization, to interrogate the causal relationships between exposure, DNA methylation and outcome. The two-step approach first uses a genetic proxy for the exposure of interest to assess the causal relationship between exposure and methylation. A second step then utilizes a genetic proxy for DNA methylation to interrogate the causal relationship between DNA methylation and outcome. The rationale, origins, methodology, advantages and limitations of this novel strategy are presented.},

We provide evidence for distinct and highly specific DNA methylation/oxidation patterns of the repetitive elements in both cell types, which mainly affect CA repeats and evolutionarily conserved mouse-specific transposable elements including IAP-LTRs, SINEs B1m/B2m, and L1Md-LINEs. DNA methylation controls the expression of these retroelements, which are clustered at specific locations in the mouse genome. We show that TDG is implicated in the regulation of their unique DNA methylation/oxidation signatures and their dynamics. Our data suggest the existence of a novel epigenetic code for the most recently acquired evolutionarily conserved repeats that could play a major role in cell differentiation.},

Genomic DNA is radioactively labeled at cleavage sites specific for a rare cleaving restriction enzyme and then size-fractionated in one dimension. The fractionated DNA is further digested with another more frequently occurring enzyme and separated in the second dimension. This procedure gives a two-dimensional pattern with thousands of scattered spots corresponding to sites for the first enzyme, indicating that the genome of mammals can be scanned at approximately 1-megabase intervals. The position and intensity of a spot reflect its locus and the copy number of the corresponding restriction site, respectively, based on the nature of the end-labeling system. Therefore, this method is widely applicable to genome mapping or detection of alterations in a genome.},

abstract = {AIMS: Bisulfite sequence analysis of individual CpG sites within genomic DNA is a powerful approach for methylation analysis in the genome. The major limitation of bisulfite-based methods is parallelization. Both array and next-generation sequencing technology are capable of addressing this bottleneck. In this report, we describe the application of Infinium{\textregistered} genotyping technology to analyze bisulfite-converted DNA to simultaneously query the methylation state of over 27,000 CpG sites from promoters of consensus coding sequences (CCDS) genes. MATERIALS {\&} METHODS: We adapted the Infinium genotyping assay to readout an array of over 27,000 pairs of CpG methylation-specific query probes complementary to bisulfite-converted DNA. Two probes were designed to each CpG site: a 'methylated' and an 'unmethylated' query probe. The probe design assumed that all underlying CpG sites were 'in phase' with the queried CpG site due to their close proximity. Bisulfite conversion was performed with a modified version of the Zymo EZ DNA Methylation™ kit. RESULTS: We applied this technology to measuring methylation levels across a panel of 14 different human tissues, four Coriell cell lines and six cancer cell lines. We observed that CpG sites within CpG islands (CGIs) were largely unmethylated across all tissues ({\~{}}80{\%} sites unmethylated, $\beta$ {\textless} 0.2), whereas CpG sites in non-CGIs were moderately to highly methylated (only {\~{}}12{\%} sites unmethylated, $\beta$ {\textless} 0.2). Within CGIs, only approximately 3-6{\%} of the loci were highly methylated; in contrast, outside of CGIs approximately 25-40{\%} of loci were highly methylated. Moreover, tissue-specific methylation (variation in methylation across tissues) was much more prevalent in non-CGIs than within CGIs. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate a genome-wide scalable array-based methylation readout platform that is both highly reproducible and quantitative. In the near future, this platform should enable the analysis of hundreds of thousands to millions of CpG sites per sample.},

abstract = {It is now understood that many human cancer types are the result of the accumulation of both genetic and epigenetic changes. DNA methylation is a molecular modification of DNA that is crucial for normal development. Genes that are rich in CpG dinucleotides are usually not methylated in normal tissues, but are frequently hypermethylated in cancer. With the advent of high-throughput platforms, large-scale structure of genomic methylation patterns is available through genome-wide scans and tremendous amount of DNA methylation data have been recently generated. However, sophisticated statistical methods to handle complex DNA methylation data are very limited. Here, we developed a likelihood based Uniform-Normal-mixture model to select differentially methylated loci between case and control groups using Illumina arrays. The idea is to model the data as three types of methylation loci, one unmethylated, one completely methylated, and one partially methylated. A three-component mixture model with two Uniform distributions and one truncated normal distribution was used to model the three types. The mixture probabilities and the mean of the normal distribution were used to make inference about differentially methylated loci. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrated the feasibility and power of the proposed method. An application to a recently published study on ovarian cancer identified several methylation loci that are missed by the existing method. {\textcopyright} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {N6-methyladenine (m(6)A) is a rare base naturally occurring in DNA. It is different from the base adenine due to its N-CH(3). Therefore, the base not only pairs with thymine, but also with other DNA bases (cytosine, adenine and guanine). In this work, M{\o}ller-Plesset second-order (MP2) method has been used to investigate the binding mechanism between m(6)A and natural DNA bases in gas phase and in aqueous solution. The results show that N-CH(3) changed the way of N6-methyladenine binding to natural DNA bases. The binding style significantly influences the stability of base pairs. The trans-m(6)A:G and trans-m(6)A:C conformers are the most stable among all the base pairs. The existence of solvent can remarkably reduce the stability of the base pairs, and the DNA bases prefer pairing with trans-m(6)A to cis-m(6)A. Besides, the properties of these hydrogen bonds have been analyzed by atom in molecules (AIM) theory, natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis and Wiberg bond indexes (WBI). In addition, pairing with m(6)A decreases the binding energies compared to the normal Watson-Crick base pairs, it may explain the instability of the N6 site methylated DNA in theory.},

abstract = {Background: Hip fractures in the elderly are associated with high 1-year mortality rates, but whether patients with other lower extremity fractures are exposed to a similar mortality risk is not clear. Questions/purposes: We evaluated the mortality of elderly patients after distal femur fractures; determined predictors for mortality; analyzed the effect of surgical delay; and compared survivorship of elderly patients with distal femur fractures with subjects in a matched hip fracture group. Patients and Methods: We included 92 consecutive patients older than 60 years with low-energy supracondylar femur fractures treated between 1999 and 2009. Patient, fracture, and treatment characteristics were extracted from operative records, charts, and radiographs. Data regarding mortality were obtained from the Social Security Death Index. Results: Age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index and a previous TKA were independent predictors for decreased survival. Congestive heart failure, dementia, renal disease, and history of malignant tumor led to shorter survival times. Patients who underwent surgery more than 4 days versus 48 hours after admission had greater 6-month and 1-year mortality risks. No differences in mortality were found comparing patients with native distal femur fractures with patients in a hip fracture control group. Conclusions: Periprosthetic fractures and fractures in patients with dementia, heart failure, advanced renal disease, and metastasis lead to reduced survival. The ageadjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index may serve as a useful tool to predict survival after distal femur fractures. Surgical delay greater than 4 days increases the 6-month and 1-year mortality risks. Mortality after native fractures of the distal femur in the geriatric population is high and similar to mortality after hip fractures. Level of Evidence: Level II, prognostic study.

As a result, 5-methylcytosine residues are hotspots for spontaneous transitions, as demonstrated in the lacI gene of Escherichia coli. We show here that in bacteria which lack uracil-DNA glycosylase (Ung-) and cannot excise uracil residues from DNA, the rate of spontaneous transition at cytosine residues is raised to the hotspot rate at 5-methylcytosine residues. These studies provide direct evidence that the deamination of cytosine is a significant source of spontaneous mutations.},

abstract = {Background: The objective of this international field study was to test the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-BM22 module to assess health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with bone metastases. Methods: Patients undergoing a variety of bone metastases-specific treatments were accrued. The QLQ-BM22 was administered with the QLQ-C30 at baseline and at 1 follow-up time point internationally. A debriefing questionnaire was administered to determine patient acceptability and understanding. Results: Large-scale field testing of the QLQ-BM22 in addition to the QLQ-C30 took place in 7 countries: Brazil, Canada, Cyprus, Egypt, France, India, and Taiwan. A total of 400 patients participated. Multitrait scaling analyses confirmed 4 scales in the 22-item module. The scales were able to discriminate between clinically distinct patient groups, such as between those with a poor and those with a better performance status. The QLQ-BM22 was well received in all 7 countries, and the majority of patients did not recommend any significant changes from the module in its current form. Conclusions: The final QLQ-BM22 module contains 22 items and 4 scales assessing Painful Sites, Painful Characteristics, Functional Interference, and Psychosocial Aspects. Results confirmed the validity, reliability, cross-cultural applicability, and sensitivity of the 22-item EORTC QLQ-BM22. It is therefore recommended that the QLQ-BM22 be used in addition to the QLQ-C30 in clinical trials to assess HRQOL in patients with bone metastases. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Cancer Society.},

abstract = {The discovery of the Ten-Eleven-Translocation (TET) oxygenases that catalyze the hydroxylation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) has triggered an avalanche of studies aiming to resolve the role of 5hmC in gene regulation if any. Hitherto, TET1 is reported to bind to CpG-island (CGI) and bivalent promoters in mouse embryonic stem cells, whereas binding at DNAseI hypersensitive sites (HS) had escaped previous analysis. Significant enrichment/accumulation of 5hmC but not 5mC can indeed be detected at bivalent promoters and at DNaseI-HS. Surprisingly, however, 5hmC is not detected or present at very low levels at CGI promoters notwithstanding the presence of TET1. Our meta-analysis of DNA methylation profiling points to potential issues with regard to the various methodologies that are part of the toolbox used to detect 5mC and 5hmC. Discrepancies between published studies and technical limitations prevent an unambiguous assignment of 5hmC as a 'true' epigenetic mark, that is, read and interpreted by other factors and/or as a transiently accumulating intermediary product of the conversion of 5mC to unmodified cytosines.},

abstract = {An epigenetic profile defining the DNA methylation age (DNAm age) of an individual has been suggested to be a biomarker of aging, and thus possibly providing a tool for assessment of health and mortality. In this study, we estimated the DNAm age of 378 Danish twins, age 30-82 years, and furthermore included a 10-year longitudinal study of the 86 oldest-old twins (mean age of 86.1 at follow-up), which subsequently were followed for mortality for 8 years. We found that the DNAm age is highly correlated with chronological age across all age groups (r = 0.97), but that the rate of change of DNAm age decreases with age. The results may in part be explained by selective mortality of those with a high DNAm age. This hypothesis was supported by a classical survival analysis showing a 35{\%} (4-77{\%}) increased mortality risk for each 5-year increase in the DNAm age vs. chronological age. Furthermore, the intrapair twin analysis revealed a more-than-double mortality risk for the DNAm oldest twin compared to the co-twin and a 'dose-response pattern' with the odds of dying first increasing 3.2 (1.05-10.1) times per 5-year DNAm age difference within twin pairs, thus showing a stronger association of DNAm age with mortality in the oldest-old when controlling for familial factors. In conclusion, our results support that DNAm age qualifies as a biomarker of aging.},

abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that many endogenous circular RNAs (circRNAs) may play roles in biological processes. However, the expression patterns and functions of circRNAs in human diseases are not well understood. Computationally identifying circRNAs from total RNA-seq data is a primary step in studying their expression pattern and biological roles. In this work, we have developed a computational pipeline named UROBORUS to detect circRNAs in total RNA-seq data. By applying UROBORUS to RNA-seq data from 46 gliomas and normal brain samples, we detected thousands of circRNAs supported by at least two read counts, followed by successful experimental validation on 24 circRNAs from the randomly selected 27 circRNAs. UROBORUS is an efficient tool that can detect circRNAs with low expression levels in total RNA-seq without RNase R treatment. The circRNAs expression profiling revealed more than 476 circular RNAs differentially expressed in control brain tissues and gliomas. Together with parental gene expression, we found that circRNA and its parental gene have diversified expression patterns in gliomas and control brain tissues. This study establishes an efficient and sensitive approach for predicting circRNAs using total RNA-seq data. The UROBORUS pipeline can be accessed freely for non-commercial purposes at http://uroborus.openbioinformatics.org/.},

abstract = {Circularization was recently recognized to broadly expand transcriptome complexity. Here, we exploit massive Drosophila total RNA-sequencing data, {\textgreater}5 billion paired-end reads from {\textgreater}100 libraries covering diverse developmental stages, tissues, and cultured cells, to rigorously annotate {\textgreater}2,500 fruit fly circular RNAs. These mostly derive from back-splicing of protein-coding genes and lack poly(A) tails, and the circularization of hundreds of genes is conserved across multiple Drosophila species. We elucidate structural and sequence properties of Drosophila circular RNAs, which exhibit commonalities and distinctions from mammalian circles. Notably, Drosophila circular RNAs harbor {\textgreater}1,000 well-conserved canonical miRNA seed matches, especially within coding regions, and coding conserved miRNA sites reside preferentially within circularized exons. Finally, we analyze the developmental and tissue specificity of circular RNAs and note their preferred derivation from neural genes and enhanced accumulation in neural tissues. Interestingly, circular isoforms increase substantially relative to linear isoforms during CNS aging and constitute an aging biomarker. Westholm etal. annotate Drosophila circular RNAs from a massive collection of total RNA-seq data, providing insights into their biogenesis and function. In particular, circularizing exons are predominantly associated with long flanking introns, are preferred locations of conserved coding miRNA sites, and accumulate to highest levels in the aging CNS.},

Here, we characterized the expression of mRNA and tRNA genes quantitatively at multiple time points in two developing mouse tissues. We discovered that mRNA codon pools are highly stable over development and simply reflect the genomic background; in contrast, precise regulation of tRNA gene families is required to create the corresponding tRNA transcriptomes. The dynamic regulation of tRNA genes during development is controlled in order to generate an anticodon pool that closely corresponds to messenger RNAs. Thus, across development, the pools of mRNA codons and tRNA anticodons are invariant and highly correlated, revealing a stable molecular interaction interlocking transcription and translation.},

abstract = {Based upon observations on 48 cases of retinoblastoma and published reports, the hypothesis is developed that retinoblastoma is a cancer caused by two mutational events. In the dominantly inherited form, one mutation is inherited via the germinal cells and the second occurs in somatic cells. In the nonhereditary form, both mutations occur in somatic cells. The second mutation produces an average of three retinoblastomas per individual inheriting the first mutation. Using Poisson statistics, one can calculate that this number (three) can explain the occasional gene carrier who gets no tumor, those who develop only unilateral tumors, and those who develop bilateral tumors, as well as explaining instances of multiple tumors in one eye. This value for the mean number of tumors occurring in genetic carriers may be used to estimate the mutation rate for each mutation. The germinal and somatic rates for the first, and the somatic rate for the second, mutation, are approximately equal. The germinal mutation may arise in some instances from a delayed mutation.},

abstract = {The cytochrome P-450 2C18 gene was found by reverse transcription-PCR to represent the most abundantly expressed gene of the P-450 2C subfamily in human epidermis. However, in addition to the canonical mRNA of nine exons, transcripts that have skipped exon 4 or 5, exons 4, 5, and 6, or exons 4, 5, 6, and 7 were also identified in this tissue. Remarkably, circular RNA transcripts synthesized by the joining of the donor and acceptor splice sites of the same exon were detected in human epidermis for exons 4 and 5. Moreover, molecules composed of exons 4, 5, and 6 with the donor splice site of exon 6 joined to the acceptor splice site of exon 4 or composed of exons 4, 5, 6, and 7 with the donor splice site of exon 7 joined to the acceptor splice site of exon 4 were also found to be present in this tissue. In rat testis, a similar analysis allowed the detection of a circular RNA molecule composed of exons 6 and 7 of the androgen binding protein (ABP) gene, with the donor splice site of exon 7 joined to the acceptor splice site of exon 6, and of an ABP mRNA which had skipped exons 6 and 7. These results apparently substantiate the hypothesis that alternative pre-mRNA splicing has the potential to generate not only mRNAs that lack one or more exons but also circular RNA molecules that are composed of the exons that are skipped. However, additional 2C18 circular species containing various combinations of exons were also detected in human epidermis, and an exon 6-skipped ABP mRNA molecule was identified in rat testis. This observation is interpreted as indicative that at low frequency, numerous circular RNA formation and exon skipping events may occur, allowing the joining of a variety of different combinations of exons. Moreover, the relative stability of these molecules is apparently the key factor that determines the relative ease of their detection.},

@article{Kotlar2006,
abstract = {BACKGROUND The question of whether synonymous codon choice is affected by cellular tRNA abundance has been positively answered in many organisms. In some recent works, concerning the human genome, this relation has been studied, but no conclusive answers have been found. In the human genome, the variation in base composition and the absence of cellular tRNA count data makes the study of the question more complicated. In this work we study the relation between codon choice and tRNA abundance in the human genome by correcting relative codon usage for background base composition and using a measure based on tRNA-gene copy numbers as a rough estimate of tRNA abundance. RESULTS We term major codons to be those codons with a relatively large tRNA-gene copy number for their corresponding amino acid. We use two measures of expression: breadth of expression (the number of tissues in which a gene was expressed) and maximum expression level among tissues (the highest value of expression of a gene among tissues). We show that for half the amino acids in the study (8 of 16) the relative major codon usage rises with breadth of expression. We show that these amino acids are significantly more frequent, are smaller and simpler, and are more ancient than the rest of the amino acids. Similar, although weaker, results were obtained for maximum expression level. CONCLUSION There is evidence that codon bias in the human genome is related to selection, although the selection forces acting on codon bias may not be straightforward and may be different for different amino acids. We suggest that, in the first group of amino acids, selection acts to enhance translation efficiency in highly expressed genes by preferring major codons, and acts to reduce translation rate in lowly expressed genes by preferring non-major ones. In the second group of amino acids other selection forces, such as reducing misincorporation rate of expensive amino acids, in terms of their size/complexity, may be in action. The fact that codon usage is more strongly related to breadth of expression than to maximum expression level supports the notion, presented in a recent study, that codon choice may be related to the tRNA abundance in the tissue in which a gene is expressed.},

abstract = {In yeast, Atg4/Apg4 is a unique cysteine protease responsible for the cleavage of the carboxyl terminus of Atg8/Apg8/Aut7, a reaction essential for its lipidation during the formation of autophagosomes. However, it is still unclear whether four human Atg4 homologues cleave the carboxyl termini of the three human Atg8 homologues, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3), GABARAP, and GATE-16. Using a cell-free system, we found that HsAtg4B, one of the human Atg4 homologues, cleaves the carboxyl termini of these three Atg8 homologues. In contrast, the mutant HsAtg4B(C74A), in which a predicted active site Cys(74) was changed to Ala, lacked proteolytic activity, indicating that Cys(74) is essential for the cleavage activity of cysteine protease. Using phospholipase D, we showed that the modified forms of endogenous LC3 and GABARAP are lipidated and therefore were designated LC3-PL and GABARAP-PL. When purified glutathione S-transferase-tagged HsAtg4B was incubated in vitro with a membrane fraction enriched with endogenous LC3-PL and GABARAP-PL, the mobility of LC3-PL and GABARAP-PL was changed to those of the unmodified proteins. These mobility shifts were not seen when Cys(74) of HsAtg4B was changed to Ala. Overexpression of wild-type HsAtg4B decreased the amount of LC3-PL and GABARAP-PL and increased the amount of unmodified endogenous LC3 and GABARAP in HeLa cells. Expression of CFP-tagged HsAtg4B (CFP-HsAtg4B) and YFP-tagged LC3 in HeLa cells under starvation conditions resulted in a significant decrease in the punctate pattern of distribution of YFP-tagged LC3 and an increase in its cytoplasmic distribution. RNA interference of HsAtg4B increased the amount of LC3-PL in HEK293 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that HsAtg4B negatively regulates the localization of LC3 to a membrane compartment by delipidation.},

abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs) represent a new type of regulatory noncoding RNA that only recently has been identified and cataloged. Emerging evidence indicates that circRNAs exert a new layer of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. In this study, we utilized transcriptome sequencing datasets to systematically identify the expression of circRNAs (including known and newly identified ones by our pipeline) in 464 RNA-seq samples, and then constructed the CircNet database (http://circnet.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/) that provides the following resources: (i) novel circRNAs, (ii) integrated miRNA-target networks, (iii) expression profiles of circRNA isoforms, (iv) genomic annotations of circRNA isoforms (e.g. 282 948 exon positions), and (v) sequences of circRNA isoforms. The CircNet database is to our knowledge the first public database that provides tissue-specific circRNA expression profiles and circRNA-miRNA-gene regulatory networks. It not only extends the most up to date catalog of circRNAs but also provides a thorough expression analysis of both previously reported and novel circRNAs. Furthermore, it generates an integrated regulatory network that illustrates the regulation between circRNAs, miRNAs and genes.},

abstract = {Whole genome sequencing (WGS) allows researchers to pinpoint genetic differences between individuals and significantly shortcuts the costly and time-consuming part of forward genetic analysis in model organism systems. Currently, the most effortintensive part of WGS is the bioinformatic analysis of the relatively short reads generated by second generation sequencing platforms. We describe here a novel, easily accessible and cloud-based pipeline, called CloudMap, which greatly simplifies the analysis of mutant genome sequences. Available on the Galaxy web platform, CloudMap requires no software installation when run on the cloud, but it can also be run locally or via Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service. CloudMap uses a series of predefined workflows to pinpoint sequence variations in animal genomes, such as those of premutagenized and mutagenized Caenorhabditis elegans strains. In combination with a variant-based mapping procedure, CloudMap allows users to sharply define genetic map intervals graphically and to retrieve very short lists of candidate variants with a few simple clicks. Automated workflows and extensive video user guides are available to detail the individual analysis steps performed (http://usegalaxy.org/cloudmap). We demonstrate the utility of CloudMap for WGS analysis of C. elegans and Arabidopsis genomes and describe how other organisms (e.g., Zebrafish and Drosophila) can easily be accommodated by this software platform. To accommodate rapid analysis of many mutants from large-scale genetic screens, Cloud- Map contains an in silico complementation testing tool that allows users to rapidly identify instances where multiple alleles of the same gene are present in the mutant collection. Lastly, we describe the application of a novel mapping/WGS method ("Variant Discovery Mapping") that does not rely on a defined polymorphic mapping strain, and we integrate the application of this method into CloudMap. CloudMap tools and documentation are continually updated at http://usegalaxy.org/cloudmap. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Genetics Society of America.},

abstract = {Multicellular organisms are characterised by role specialisation, brought about by the epigenetic differentiation of their constituent parts. Conventional game theoretic studies of cooperation do not account for this division of labour, nor do they allow for the possibility of the plastic expression of phenotype. We address these issues by extending the notion of cooperative dilemmas to account for such interaction in which heterogeneous roles are advantageous and present an extended dynamical model of selection that allows for the possibility of conditional expression of phenotype. We use these models to investigate systematically when selection will favour an adaptive diversification of roles. We argue that such extensions to models and concepts are necessary to understand the origins of multicellularity and development.},

abstract = {In recent years salicylic acid (SA) has been the focus of intensive research due to its function as an endogenous signal mediating local and systemic plant defence responses against pathogens. It has also been found that SA plays a role during the plant response to abiotic stresses such as drought, chilling, heavy metal toxicity, heat, and osmotic stress. In this sense, SA appears to be, just like in mammals, an 'effective therapeutic agent' for plants. Besides this function during biotic and abiotic stress, SA plays a crucial role in the regulation of physiological and biochemical processes during the entire lifespan of the plant. The discovery of its targets and the understanding of its molecular modes of action in physiological processes could help in the dissection of the complex SA signalling network, confirming its important role in both plant health and disease. Here, the evidence that supports the role of SA during plant growth and development is reviewed by comparing experiments performed by exogenous application of SA with analysis of genotypes affected by SA levels and/or perception.},

@article{Rymarquis2011,
abstract = {One of the major players controlling RNA decay is the cytoplasmic 5'-to-3' exoribonuclease, which is conserved among eukaryotic organisms. In Arabidopsis, the 5'-to-3' exoribonuclease XRN4 is involved in disease resistance, the response to ethylene, RNAi, and miRNA-mediated RNA decay. Curiously, XRN4 appears to display selectivity among its substrates because certain 3' cleavage products formed by miRNA-mediated decay, such as from ARF10 mRNA, accumulate in the xrn4 mutant, whereas others, such as from AGO1, do not. To examine the nature of this selectivity, transcripts that differentially accumulate in xrn4 were identified by combining PARE and Affymetrix arrays. Certain functional categories, such as stamen-associated proteins and hydrolases, were over-represented among transcripts decreased in xrn4, whereas transcripts encoding nuclear-encoded chloroplast-targeted proteins and nucleic acid-binding proteins were over-represented in transcripts increased in xrn4. To ascertain if RNA sequence influences the apparent XRN4 selectivity, a series of chimeric constructs was generated in which the miRNA-complementary sites and different portions of the surrounding sequences from AGO1 and ARF10 were interchanged. Analysis of the resulting transgenic plants revealed that the presence of a 150 nucleotide sequence downstream from the ARF10 miRNA-complementary site conferred strong accumulation of the 3' cleavage products in xrn4. In addition, sequence analysis of differentially accumulating transcripts led to the identification of 27 hexamer motifs that were over-represented in transcripts or miRNA-cleavage products accumulating in xrn4. Taken together, the data indicate that specific mRNA sequences, like those in ARF10, and mRNAs from select functional categories are attractive targets for XRN4-mediated decay.},

abstract = {Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) have been important in shaping biomolecular evolution. Initiator tRNAs (tRNAi), a special class of tRNAs, carry methionine (or its derivative, formyl-methionine) to ribosomes to start an enormously energy consuming but a highly regulated process of protein synthesis. The processes of tRNAi evolution, and selection of methionine as the universal initiating amino acid remain an enigmatic problem. We constructed phylogenetic trees using the whole sequence, the acceptor-T$\psi$C arm ('minihelix'), and the anticodon-dihydrouridine arm regions of tRNAi from 158 species belonging to all 3 domains of life. All the trees distinctly assembled into 3 domains of life. Large trees, generated using data for all the tRNAs of a vast number of species, fail to reveal the major evolutionary events and identity of the probable elongator tRNA sequences that could be ancestor of tRNAi. Therefore, we constructed trees using the minihelix or the whole sequence of species specific tRNAs, and iterated our analysis on 50 eubacterial species. We identified tRNAPro, tRNAGlu, or tRNAThr (but surprisingly not elongator tRNAMet) as probable ancestors of tRNAi. We then determined the factors imposing selection of methionine as the initiating amino acid. Overall frequency of occurrence of methionine, whose metabolic cost of synthesis is the highest among all amino acids, remains almost unchanged across the 3 domains of life. Our correlation analysis shows that its high metabolic cost is independent of many physicochemical properties of the side chain. Our results indicate that selection of methionine, as the initiating amino acid was possibly a consequence of the evolution of one-carbon metabolism, which plays an important role in regulating translation initiation.},

abstract = {The accumulation of insoluble proteins is a pathological hallmark of several neurodegenerative disorders. Tauopathies are caused by the dysfunction and aggregation of tau protein and an impairment of cellular protein degradation pathways may contribute to their pathogenesis. Thus, a deficiency in autophagy can cause neurodegeneration, while activation of autophagy is protective against some proteinopathies. Little is known about the role of autophagy in animal models of human tauopathy. In the present report, we assessed the effects of autophagy stimulation by trehalose in a transgenic mouse model of tauopathy, the human mutant P301S tau mouse, using biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses. Neuronal survival was evaluated by stereology. Autophagy was activated in the brain, where the number of neurons containing tau inclusions was significantly reduced, as was the amount of insoluble tau protein. This reduction in tau aggregates was associated with improved neuronal survival in the cerebral cortex and the brainstem. We also observed a decrease of p62 protein, suggesting that it may contribute to the removal of tau inclusions. Trehalose failed to activate autophagy in the spinal cord, where it had no impact on the level of sarkosyl-insoluble tau. Accordingly, trehalose had no effect on the motor impairment of human mutant P301S tau transgenic mice. Our findings provide direct evidence in favour of the degradation of tau aggregates by autophagy. Activation of autophagy may be worth investigating in the context of therapies for human tauopathies.},

abstract = {Background Epigenetic clocks based on DNA methylation yield high correlations with chronological age in cross-sectional data. Due to a paucity of longitudinal data, it is not known how $\Delta$age (epigenetic age - chronological age) changes over time or if it remains constant from childhood to old age. Here, we investigate this using longitudinal DNA methylation data from five datasets, covering most of the human life course. Methods Two measures of the epigenetic clock (Hannum and Horvath) are used to calculate $\Delta$age in the following cohorts: Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) offspring (n = 986, total age-range 7-19 years, 2 waves), ALSPAC mothers (n = 982, 16-60 years, 2 waves), InCHIANTI (n = 460, 21-100 years, 2 waves), SATSA (n = 373, 48-99 years, 5 waves), Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (n = 1,054, 70-76 years, 3 waves), and Lothian Birth Cohort 1921 (n = 476, 79-90 years, 3 waves). Linear mixed models were used to track longitudinal change in $\Delta$age within each cohort. Results For both epigenetic age measures, $\Delta$age showed a declining trend in almost all of the cohorts. The correlation between $\Delta$age across waves ranged from 0.22 to 0.82 for Horvath and 0.25 to 0.71 for Hannum, with stronger associations in samples collected closer in time. Conclusions Epigenetic age increases at a slower rate than chronological age across the life course, especially in the oldest population. Some of the effect is likely driven by survival bias, where healthy individuals are those maintained within a longitudinal study, although other factors like the age distribution of the underlying training population may also have influenced this trend.},

The circular RNA is found in the cytoplasm but is not substantially bound to polysomes. We suggest that the circles arise from normal splicing processes as a consequence of the unusual genomic structure surrounding the Sry locus in the mouse. ?? 1993.},

abstract = {Maternal vitamin D deficiency has been associated with reduced offspring bone mineral accrual. Retinoid-X receptor-alpha (RXRA) is an essential cofactor in the action of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]2 -vitamin D), and RXRA methylation in umbilical cord DNA has been associated with later offspring adiposity. We tested the hypothesis that RXRA methylation in umbilical cord DNA collected at birth is associated with offspring skeletal development, assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, in a population-based mother-offspring cohort (Southampton Women's Survey). Relationships between maternal plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]-vitamin D) concentrations and cord RXRA methylation were also investigated. In 230 children aged 4 years, a higher percent methylation at four of six RXRA CpG sites measured was correlated with lower offspring bone mineral content (BMC) corrected for body size ($\beta$ = -2.1 to -3.4 g/SD, p = 0.002 to 0.047). In a second independent cohort (n = 64), similar negative associations at two of these CpG sites, but positive associations at the two remaining sites, were observed; however, none of the relationships in this replication cohort achieved statistical significance. The maternal free 25(OH)-vitamin D index was negatively associated with methylation at one of these RXRA CpG sites ($\beta$ = -3.3 SD/unit, p = 0.03). Thus, perinatal epigenetic marking at the RXRA promoter region in umbilical cord was inversely associated with offspring size-corrected BMC in childhood. The potential mechanistic and functional significance of this finding remains a subject for further investigation.},

abstract = {We consider rules for discarding predictors in lasso regression and related problems, for computational efficiency. El Ghaoui and his colleagues have proposed 'SAFE' rules, based on univariate inner products between each predictor and the outcome, which guarantee that a coefficient will be 0 in the solution vector. This provides a reduction in the number of variables that need to be entered into the optimization. We propose strong rules that are very simple and yet screen out far more predictors than the SAFE rules. This great practical improvement comes at a price: the strong rules are not foolproof and can mistakenly discard active predictors, i.e. predictors that have non-zero coefficients in the solution. We therefore combine them with simple checks of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions to ensure that the exact solution to the convex problem is delivered. Of course, any (approximate) screening method can be combined with the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions to ensure the exact solution; the strength of the strong rules lies in the fact that, in practice, they discard a very large number of the inactive predictors and almost never commit mistakes. We also derive conditions under which they are foolproof. Strong rules provide substantial savings in computational time for a variety of statistical optimization problems. {\textcopyright} 2011 Royal Statistical Society.},

abstract = {Genomic instability and alterations in gene expression are hallmarks of eukaryotic aging. The yeast histone deacetylase Sir2 silences transcription and stabilizes repetitive DNA, but during aging or in response to a DNA break, the Sir complex relocalizes to sites of genomic instability, resulting in the desilencing of genes that cause sterility, a characteristic of yeast aging. Using embryonic stem cells, we show that mammalian Sir2, SIRT1, represses repetitive DNA and a functionally diverse set of genes across the mouse genome. In response to DNA damage, SIRT1 dissociates from these loci and relocalizes to DNA breaks to promote repair, resulting in transcriptional changes that parallel those in the aging mouse brain. Increased SIRT1 expression promotes survival in a mouse model of genomic instability and suppresses age-dependent transcriptional changes. Thus, DNA damage-induced redistribution of SIRT1 and other chromatin-modifying proteins may be a conserved mechanism of aging in eukaryotes. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are widely expressed noncoding RNAs. However, their biogenesis and possible functions are poorly understood. Here, by studying circRNAs that we identified in neuronal tissues, we provide evidence that animal circRNAs are generated cotranscriptionally and that their production rate is mainly determined by intronic sequences. We demonstrate that circularization and splicing compete against each other. These mechanisms are tissue specific and conserved in animals. Interestingly, we observed that the second exon of the splicing factor muscleblind (MBL/MBNL1) is circularized in flies and humans. This circRNA (circMbl) and its flanking introns contain conserved muscleblind binding sites, which are strongly and specifically bound by MBL. Modulation of MBL levels strongly affects circMbl biosynthesis, and this effect is dependent on the MBL binding sites. Together, our data suggest that circRNAs can function in gene regulation by competing with linear splicing. Furthermore, we identified muscleblind as a factor involved in circRNA biogenesis.},

abstract = {The naked mole-rat is the longest living rodent with a maximum lifespan exceeding 28 years. In addition to its longevity, naked mole-rats have an extraordinary resistance to cancer as tumors have never been observed in these rodents. Furthermore, we show that a combination of activated Ras and SV40 LT fails to induce robust anchorage-independent growth in naked mole-rat cells, while it readily transforms mouse fibroblasts. The mechanisms responsible for the cancer resistance of naked mole-rats were unknown. Here we show that naked mole-rat fibroblasts display hypersensitivity to contact inhibition, a phenomenon we termed "early contact inhibition." Contact inhibition is a key anticancer mechanism that arrests cell division when cells reach a high density. In cell culture, naked mole-rat fibroblasts arrest at a much lower density than those from a mouse. We demonstrate that early contact inhibition requires the activity of p53 and pRb tumor suppressor pathways. Inactivation of both p53 and pRb attenuates early contact inhibition. Contact inhibition in human and mouse is triggered by the induction of p27(Kip1). In contrast, early contact inhibition in naked mole-rat is associated with the induction of p16(Ink4a). Furthermore, we show that the roles of p16(Ink4a) and p27(Kip1) in the control of contact inhibition became temporally separated in this species: the early contact inhibition is controlled by p16(Ink4a), and regular contact inhibition is controlled by p27(Kip1). We propose that the additional layer of protection conferred by two-tiered contact inhibition contributes to the remarkable tumor resistance of the naked mole-rat.},

To this end, both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria have evolved specialized mechanisms to transport their proteins to the bacterial supernatant or host cell cytoplasm, so called secretion systems. These different strategies will be briefly discussed, followed by an in depth description of the Type III secretion system, an efficient molecular syringe assisting Gram-negative bacteria in entrance, growth and survival in eukaryotic host cells. Topics addressed include classification and role of multiple Type III secretion systems, the mechanism of protein translocation into the host cell as well as substrate recognition and chaperoning. Chlamydiales have also been found to encode a Type III secretion system and associated effector proteins. In contrast to the genetic organization in other bacteria, the encoding genes are scattered throughout the genome. To date, no structural information is available on the chlamydial Type III secretion system. We therefore propose a model of the chlamydial Type III secretion system and summarize current knowledge on the role of Type III secretion in the different stages of the chlamydial developmental cycle.},

abstract = {Naked mole rat (NMR) is a valuable model for aging and cancer research due to its exceptional longevity and cancer resistance. We observed that the reprogramming efficiency of NMR fibroblasts in response to OSKM was drastically lower than that of mouse fibroblasts. Expression of SV40 LargeT antigen (LT) dramatically improved reprogramming of NMR fibroblasts. Inactivation of Rb alone, but not p53, was sufficient to improve reprogramming efficiency, suggesting that NMR chromatin may be refractory to reprogramming. Analysis of the global histone landscape revealed that NMR had higher levels of repressive H3K27 methylation marks and lower levels of activating H3K27 acetylation marks than mouse. ATAC-seq revealed that in NMR, promoters of reprogramming genes were more closed than mouse promoters, while expression of LT led to massive opening of the NMR promoters. These results suggest that NMR displays a more stable epigenome that resists de-differentiation, contributing to the cancer resistance and longevity of this species. Tan et al. show that a more stable epigenome contributes to the resistance of NMR iPSCs to OSKM reprogramming. Reprogramming is facilitated by inactivation of Rb, which leads to opening of promoters of reprogramming genes.},

abstract = {Background: GenoGAM (Genome-wide generalized additive models) is a powerful statistical modeling tool for the analysis of ChIP-Seq data with flexible factorial design experiments. However large runtime and memory requirements of its current implementation prohibit its application to gigabase-scale genomes such as mammalian genomes. Results: Here we present GenoGAM 2.0, a scalable and efficient implementation that is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude faster than the previous version. This is achieved by exploiting the sparsity of the model using the SuperLU direct solver for parameter fitting, and sparse Cholesky factorization together with the sparse inverse subset algorithm for computing standard errors. Furthermore the HDF5 library is employed to store data efficiently on hard drive, reducing memory footprint while keeping I/O low. Whole-genome fits for human ChIP-seq datasets (ca. 300 million parameters) could be obtained in less than 9 hours on a standard 60-core server. GenoGAM 2.0 is implemented as an open source R package and currently available on GitHub. A Bioconductor release of the new version is in preparation. Conclusions: We have vastly improved the performance of the GenoGAM framework, opening up its application to all types of organisms. Moreover, our algorithmic improvements for fitting large GAMs could be of interest to the statistical community beyond the genomics field.},

While standard interchange formats exist (for example, Chemical Markup Language) and de facto standards have arisen (for example, SMILES format), the need to interconvert formats is a continuing problem due to the multitude of different application areas for chemistry data, differences in the data stored by different formats (0D versus 3D, for example), and competition between software along with a lack of vendor-neutral formats.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We discuss, for the first time, Open Babel, an open-source chemical toolbox that speaks the many languages of chemical data. Open Babel version 2.3 interconverts over 110 formats. The need to represent such a wide variety of chemical and molecular data requires a library that implements a wide range of cheminformatics algorithms, from partial charge assignment and aromaticity detection, to bond order perception and canonicalization. We detail the implementation of Open Babel, describe key advances in the 2.3 release, and outline a variety of uses both in terms of software products and scientific research, including applications far beyond simple format interconversion.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Open Babel presents a solution to the proliferation of multiple chemical file formats. In addition, it provides a variety of useful utilities from conformer searching and 2D depiction, to filtering, batch conversion, and substructure and similarity searching.

There has been considerable interest in whether environmental factors modulate the establishment and maintenance of epigenetic modifications, and could thereby influence gene expression and phenotype. Chemical pollutants, dietary components, temperature changes and other external stresses can indeed have long-lasting effects on development, metabolism and health, sometimes even in subsequent generations. Although the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown, particularly in humans, mechanistic insights are emerging from experimental model systems. These have implications for structuring future research and understanding disease and development. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Aging is the most important risk factor for major human lifestyle diseases, including cancer, neurological and cardiometabolic disorders. Due to the complex interplay between genetics, lifestyle and environmental factors, some individuals seem to age faster than others, whereas centenarians seem to have a slower aging process. Therefore, a biochemical biomarker reflecting the relative biological age would be helpful to predict an individual's health status and aging disease risk. Although it is already known for years that cumulative epigenetic changes occur upon aging, DNA methylation patterns were only recently used to construct an epigenetic clock predictor for biological age, which is a measure of how well your body functions compared to your chronological age. Moreover, the epigenetic DNA methylation clock signature is increasingly applied as a biomarker to estimate aging disease susceptibility and mortality risk. Finally, the epigenetic clock signature could be used as a lifestyle management tool to monitor healthy aging, to evaluate preventive interventions against chronic aging disorders and to extend healthy lifespan. Dissecting the mechanism of the epigenetic aging clock will yield valuable insights into the aging process and how it can be manipulated to improve health span.},

abstract = {The bacterium Myxococcus xanthus has two motility systems: S motility, which is powered by type IV pilus retraction, and A motility, which is powered by unknown mechanism(s). We found that A motility involved transient adhesion complexes that remained at fixed positions relative to the substratum as cells moved forward. Complexes assembled at leading cell poles and dispersed at the rear of the cells. When cells reversed direction, the A-motility clusters relocalized to the new leading poles together with S-motility proteins. The Frz chemosensory system coordinated the two motility systems. The dynamics of protein cluster localization suggest that intracellular motors and force transmission by dynamic focal adhesions can power bacterial motility.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Chronic low-grade inflammation reflects a subclinical immune response implicated in the pathogenesis of complex diseases. Identifying genetic loci where DNA methylation is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation may reveal novel pathways or therapeutic targets for inflammation. RESULTS We performed a meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of serum C-reactive protein (CRP), which is a sensitive marker of low-grade inflammation, in a large European population (n = 8863) and trans-ethnic replication in African Americans (n = 4111). We found differential methylation at 218 CpG sites to be associated with CRP (P {\textless} 1.15 × 10-7) in the discovery panel of European ancestry and replicated (P {\textless} 2.29 × 10-4) 58 CpG sites (45 unique loci) among African Americans. To further characterize the molecular and clinical relevance of the findings, we examined the association with gene expression, genetic sequence variants, and clinical outcomes. DNA methylation at nine (16{\%}) CpG sites was associated with whole blood gene expression in cis (P {\textless} 8.47 × 10-5), ten (17{\%}) CpG sites were associated with a nearby genetic variant (P {\textless} 2.50 × 10-3), and 51 (88{\%}) were also associated with at least one related cardiometabolic entity (P {\textless} 9.58 × 10-5). An additive weighted score of replicated CpG sites accounted for up to 6{\%} inter-individual variation (R2) of age-adjusted and sex-adjusted CRP, independent of known CRP-related genetic variants. CONCLUSION We have completed an EWAS of chronic low-grade inflammation and identified many novel genetic loci underlying inflammation that may serve as targets for the development of novel therapeutic interventions for inflammation.},

abstract = {The accurate and efficient transfer of genetic information into amino acid sequences is carried out through codon-anticodon interactions between mRNA and tRNA, respectively. In this way, tRNAs function at the interface between gene expression and protein synthesis. Whether tRNA levels are dynamically regulated and to what degree tRNA abundance influences the cellular proteome remains largely unexplored. Here we profile tRNA, transcript and protein levels in Drosophila Kc167 cells, a plasmatocyte cell line that, upon treatment with 20-hydroxyecdysone, differentiates into macrophages. We find that high abundance tRNAs associate with codons that are overrepresented in the Kc167 cell proteome, whereas tRNAs that are in low supply associate with codons that are underrepresented. Ecdysone-induced differentiation of Kc167 cells leads to changes in mRNA codon usage in a manner consistent with the developmental progression of the cell. At both early and late time points, ecdysone treatment concomitantly increases the abundance of tRNAThr(CGU), which decodes a differentiation-associated codon that becomes enriched in the macrophage proteome. These results together suggest that tRNA levels may provide a meaningful regulatory mechanism for defining the cellular proteomic landscape.},

The computational analysis of such data, however, still falls short on accuracy, sensitivity, and speed. We propose a time-efficient statistical method that is able to cope with the inherent complexity of MeDIP-seq data with similar performance compared with existing methods. In order to demonstrate the computational approach, we have analyzed alterations in DNA methylation during the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to definitive endoderm. We show improved correlation of normalized MeDIP-seq data in comparison to available whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data, and investigated the effect of differential methylation on gene expression. Furthermore, we analyzed the interplay between DNA methylation, histone modifications, and transcription factor binding and show that in contrast to de novo methylation, demethylation is mainly associated with regions of low CpG densities. {\textcopyright} 2010 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

abstract = {MAVIDOS is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (ISRCTN82927713, registered 2008 Apr 11), funded by Arthritis Research UK, MRC, Bupa Foundation and NIHR. BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is a major public health problem as a result of associated fragility fractures. Skeletal strength increases from birth to a peak in early adulthood. This peak predicts osteoporosis risk in later life. Vitamin D insufficiency in pregnancy is common (31{\%} in a recent Southampton cohort) and predicts reduced bone mass in the offspring. In this study we aim to test whether offspring of mothers supplemented with vitamin D in pregnancy have higher bone mass at birth than those whose mothers were not supplemented. METHODS/DESIGN: Women have their vitamin D status assessed after ultrasound scanning in the twelfth week of pregnancy at 3 trial centres (Southampton, Sheffield, Oxford). Women with circulating 25(OH)-vitamin D levels 25-100 nmol/l are randomised in a double-blind design to either oral vitamin D supplement (1000 IU cholecalciferol/day, n = 477) or placebo at 14 weeks (n = 477). Questionnaire data include parity, sunlight exposure, dietary information, and cigarette and alcohol consumption. At 19 and 34 weeks maternal anthropometry is assessed and blood samples taken to measure 25(OH)-vitamin D, PTH and biochemistry. At delivery venous umbilical cord blood is collected, together with umbilical cord and placental tissue. The babies undergo DXA assessment of bone mass within the first 14 days after birth, with the primary outcome being whole body bone mineral content adjusted for gestational age and age. Children are then followed up with yearly assessment of health, diet, physical activity and anthropometric measures, with repeat assessment of bone mass by DXA at age 4 years. DISCUSSION: As far as we are aware, this randomised trial is one of the first ever tests of the early life origins hypothesis in human participants and has the potential to inform public health policy regarding vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy. It will also provide a valuable resource in which to study the influence of maternal vitamin D status on other childhood outcomes such as glucose tolerance, blood pressure, cardiovascular function, IQ and immunology.},

Using a transchromosomic mouse strain that transmits an almost complete single copy of human chromosome 21 via the female germline, we show that a heterologous regulatory environment can transcriptionally activate transposon-derived human regulatory regions. In the mouse nucleus, hundreds of locations on human chromosome 21 newly associate with activating histone modifications in both somatic and germline tissues, and influence the gene expression of nearby transcripts. These regions are enriched with primate and human lineage-specific transposable elements, and their activation corresponds to changes in DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides.

abstract = {7SL RNA is an abundant cytoplasmic RNA which functions in protein secretion as a component of the signal recognition particle. Alu sequences are the most abundant family of human and rodent middle repetitive DNA sequences (reviewed in ref. 2). The primary structure of human 7SL RNA consists of an Alu sequence interrupted by a 155-base pair (bp) sequence that is unique to 7SL RNA. In order to obtain information about the evolution of the Alu domain of 7SL RNA, we have determined the nucleotide sequence of a cDNA copy of Xenopus laevis 7SL RNA and of the 7SL RNA gene of Drosophila melanogaster. We find that the Xenopus sequence is 87{\%} homologous with its human counterpart and the Drosophila 7SL RNA is 64{\%} homologous to both the human and amphibian molecules. Despite the evolutionary distance between the species, significant blocks of homology to both the Alu and 7SL-specific portions of mammalian 7SL RNA can be found in the insect sequence. These results clearly demonstrate that the Alu sequence in 7SL RNA appeared in evolution before the mammalian radiation. We suggest that mammalian Alu sequences were derived from 7SL RNA (or DNA) by a deletion of the central 7SL-specific sequence, and are therefore processed 7SL RNA genes.},

abstract = {Understanding relationships between sets is an important analysis task that has received widespread attention in the visualization community. The major challenge in this context is the combinatorial explosion of the number of set intersections if the number of sets exceeds a trivial threshold. In this paper we introduce UpSet, a novel visualization technique for the quantitative analysis of sets, their intersections, and aggregates of intersections. UpSet is focused on creating task-driven aggregates, communi- cating the size and properties of aggregates and intersections, and a duality between the visualization of the elements in a dataset and their set membership. UpSet visualizes set intersections in a matrix layout and introduces aggregates based on groupings and queries. The matrix layout enables the effective representation of associated data, such as the number of elements in the aggregates and intersections, as well as additional summary statistics derived from subset or element attributes. Sorting according to various measures enables a task-driven analysis of relevant intersections and aggregates. The elements represented in the sets and their associated attributes are visualized in a separate view. Queries based on containment in specific intersections, aggregates or driven by attribute filters are propagated between both views. We also introduce several advanced visual encodings and interaction methods to overcome the problems of varying scales and to address scalability. UpSet is web-based and open source. We demonstrate its general utility in multiple use cases from various domains},

abstract = {Only a few years ago it was demonstrated that mammalian DNA contains oxidized forms of 5-methylcytosine (5mC). The base 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is the most abundant of these oxidation products and is referred to as the sixth DNA base. 5hmC is produced from 5mC in an enzymatic pathway involving three 5mC oxidases, Ten-eleven translocation (TET)1, TET2, and TET3. The biological role of 5hmC is still unclear. Current models propose that 5hmC is an intermediate base in an active or passive DNA demethylation process that operates during important reprogramming phases of mammalian development. Tumors originating in various human tissues have strongly depleted levels of 5hmC. Apparently, 5hmC cannot be maintained in proliferating cells. Furthermore, mutations in the TET2 gene are commonly observed in human myeloid malignancies. Since TET proteins and many lysine demethylases require 2-oxoglutarate as a cofactor, aberrations in cofactor biochemical pathways, including mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), may affect levels of 5hmC and 5mC in certain types of tumors, either directly or indirectly. We discuss current data and models of the function of 5hmC in general, with special emphasis on its role in mechanisms of development and cancer.},

abstract = {The DNA sequence of the gene for the fermentative yeast alcohol dehydrogenase has been determined. The structural gene contains no introns. The amino acid sequence of the protein as determined from the nucleotide sequence disagrees with the published alcohol dehydrogenase isozyme I (ADH-I) sequence for 5 of the 347 amino acid residues. At least one, and perhaps as many as four, of these differences is probably due to ADH-I protein heterogeneity in different yeast strains and not to sequencing errors. S1 nuclease was used to map the 5' and 3' ends of the ADH-I mRNA. There are two discrete, mature 5' ends of the mRNA, mapping 27 and 37 nucleotides upstream of the translation initiating ATG. These two equally prevalent termini are 101 and 91 nucleotides, respectively, downstream from a TATAAA sequence. Analysis of the 3' end of ADH-I mRNA disclosed two minor ends upstream of the major poly(A) addition site. These three ends map 24, 67, and 83 nucleotides, respectively, downstream from the translation-terminating TAA triplet. The sequence AA-TAAG is found 28 to 34 nucleotides upstream of each ADH-I mRNA poly(A) addition site. Sequence comparisons of these three 3' ends with those for four other yeast mRNAs yielded a 13-nucleotide consensus sequence to which TAAATAAGA is central. All of the known yeast poly(A) addition sites map at or near the A residue of a CTA site 25 to 40 nucleotides downstream from this consensus octamer.},

abstract = {Approximately 1.5 billion people worldwide are overweight or affected by obesity, and are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and related metabolic and inflammatory disturbances. Although the mechanisms linking adiposity to associated clinical conditions are poorly understood, recent studies suggest that adiposity may influence DNA methylation, a key regulator of gene expression and molecular phenotype. Here we use epigenome-wide association to show that body mass index (BMI; a key measure of adiposity) is associated with widespread changes in DNA methylation (187 genetic loci with P {\textless} 1 × 10-7, range P = 9.2 × 10-8 to 6.0 × 10-46; n = 10,261 samples). Genetic association analyses demonstrate that the alterations in DNA methylation are predominantly the consequence of adiposity, rather than the cause. We find that methylation loci are enriched for functional genomic features in multiple tissues (P {\textless} 0.05), and show that sentinel methylation markers identify gene expression signatures at 38 loci (P {\textless} 9.0 × 10-6, range P = 5.5 × 10-6 to 6.1 × 10-35, n = 1,785 samples). The methylation loci identify genes involved in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, substrate transport and inflammatory pathways. Finally, we show that the disturbances in DNA methylation predict future development of type 2 diabetes (relative risk per 1 standard deviation increase in methylation risk score: 2.3 (2.07-2.56); P = 1.1 × 10-54). Our results provide new insights into the biologic pathways influenced by adiposity, and may enable development of new strategies for prediction and prevention of type 2 diabetes and other adverse clinical consequences of obesity.},

abstract = {We explored the association between gestational age and cord blood DNA methylation at birth and whether DNA methylation could be effective in predicting gestational age due to limitations with the presently used methods. We used data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Birth Cohort study (MoBa) with Illumina HumanMethylation450 data measured for 1753 newborns in two batches: MoBa 1, n = 1068; and MoBa 2, n = 685. Gestational age was computed using both ultrasound and the last menstrual period. We evaluated associations between DNA methylation and gestational age and developed a statistical model for predicting gestational age using MoBa 1 for training and MoBa 2 for predictions. The prediction model was additionally used to compare ultrasound and last menstrual period-based gestational age predictions. Furthermore, both CpGs and associated genes detected in the training models were compared to those detected in a published prediction model for chronological age. There were 5474 CpGs associated with ultrasound gestational age after adjustment for a set of covariates, including estimated cell type proportions, and Bonferroni-correction for multiple testing. Our model predicted ultrasound gestational age more accurately than it predicted last menstrual period gestational age. DNA methylation at birth appears to be a good predictor of gestational age. Ultrasound gestational age is more strongly associated with methylation than last menstrual period gestational age. The CpGs linked with our gestational age prediction model, and their associated genes, differed substantially from the corresponding CpGs and genes associated with a chronological age prediction model.},

@article{Graur2013,
abstract = {A recent slew of ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Consortium publications, specifically the article signed by all Consortium members, put forward the idea that more than 80{\%} of the human genome is functional. This claim flies in the face of current estimates according to which the fraction of the genome that is evolutionarily conserved through purifying selection is less than 10{\%}. Thus, according to the ENCODE Consortium, a biological function can be maintained indefinitely without selection, which implies that at least 80 - 10 = 70{\%} of the genome is perfectly invulnerable to deleterious mutations, either because no mutation can ever occur in these "functional" regions or because no mutation in these regions can ever be deleterious. This absurd conclusion was reached through various means, chiefly by employing the seldom used "causal role" definition of biological function and then applying it inconsistently to different biochemical properties, by committing a logical fallacy known as "affirming the consequent," by failing to appreciate the crucial difference between "junk DNA" and "garbage DNA," by using analytical methods that yield biased errors and inflate estimates of functionality, by favoring statistical sensitivity over specificity, and by emphasizing statistical significance rather than the magnitude of the effect. Here, we detail the many logical and methodological transgressions involved in assigning functionality to almost every nucleotide in the human genome. The ENCODE results were predicted by one of its authors to necessitate the rewriting of textbooks. We agree, many textbooks dealing with marketing, mass-media hype, and public relations may well have to be rewritten.},

We compared replication timing in divergent yeast species and identified genomic features with conserved replication times. Histone genes were among the earliest replicating loci in all species. We specifically delayed the replication of HTA1 - HTB1 and discovered that this halved the expression of these histone genes. Finally, we showed that histone and cell cycle genes in general are exempt from Rtt109-dependent dosage compensation, suggesting the existence of pathways excluding specific loci from dosage compensation mechanisms. Thus, we have uncovered one of the first physiological requirements for regulated replication time and demonstrated a direct link between replication timing and gene expression.},

abstract = {UME6 is a protein of 836 amino acids from Saccharomyces cerevisiae that acts as a repressor and activator of several early meiotic genes. UME6 contains, near the C-terminus, the amino acid sequence-771C-X2-C-X6-C-X6-C-X2-C-X6-C-, in which the spacings of the six Cys residues are identical to those found in 39 N-terminal Cys-rich DNA binding subdomains of fungal transcription factors. This sequence has been shown in GAL4 and other proteins to form a zinc binuclear cluster. In spite of the different location, the C-rich sequence, cloned and over-produced within the last 111 amino acid residues of UME6, UME6(111), forms a binuclear cluster and exhibits a Zn-dependent binding to the URS1 DNA sequence. The latter, TAGCCGCCGA, is required for the repression or activation of meiosis-specific genes by UME6. UME6(111) contains 1.8 +/- 0.4 mol Zn/mol protein and the Zn can be exchanged for Cd to yield a protein containing 1.9 +/- 0.1 mol Cd/mol protein. At 5 degrees C, 113Cd2UME6(111) shows two 113Cd NMR signals, with chemical shifts of 699 and 689 ppm, similar to those observed for 113Cd2GAL4(149). The magnitude of these chemical shifts suggests that each 113Cd nucleus is coordinated to four -S- ligands, compatible with a 113Cd2 cluster structure in which two thiolates from bridging ligands. The entire UME6 gene has been cloned and overexpressed and binds more tightly to the URS1 sequence than the zinc binuclear cluster domain alone. DNase I footprints of UME6 on URS1-containing DNA show that the protein protects the phosphodiesters of the 5'-CCGCCG-3' region within the URS1 sequence.},

Here we demonstrate that the UHRF1 mutants deficient in binding either hemi-methylated CpG or H3K9me2/3, but not both, are able to associate with pericentric heterochromatin, recruit Dnmt1 and partially rescue DNA methylation defects in mouse Uhrf1 null ES cells. Furthermore, we present evidence that the flip out of the methylated cytosine induced by UHRF1 binding is unlikely essential for subsequent DNA methylation by DNMT1. Together, our study demonstrates that UHRF1 can target DNMT1 for DNA maintenance methylation through binding either H3K9me2/3 or hemi-methylated CpG, and that the presence of both binding activities ensures high fidelity DNA maintenance methylation. In addition, our study indicates that UHRF1 mediates cross-talk between H3K9 methylation and DNA methylation at the level of DNA methylation maintenance.},

Applying single-cell sequencing to murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, we observed that these mutations disrupt hematopoietic differentiation, causing opposite shifts in the frequencies of erythroid versus myelomonocytic progenitors following Tet2 or Dnmt3a loss. Notably, these shifts trace back to transcriptional priming skews in uncommitted hematopoietic stem cells. To reconcile genome-wide DNAme changes with specific erythroid versus myelomonocytic skews, we provide evidence in support of differential sensitivity of transcription factors due to biases in CpG enrichment in their binding motif. Single-cell transcriptomes with targeted genotyping showed similar skews in transcriptional priming of DNMT3A-mutated human clonal hematopoiesis bone marrow progenitors. These data show that DNAme shapes the topography of hematopoietic differentiation, and support a model in which genome-wide methylation changes are transduced to differentiation skews through biases in CpG enrichment of the transcription factor binding motif.},

In contrast to these characterized factors, some of the components reported to influence porin expression have only modest effects and/or act indirectly. For others, potential regulatory roles, although intriguing, remain elusive.

abstract = {1. A method is described whereby the major components of liver suspensions are segregated according to size into three main fractions: (a) a large granule fraction composed of elements approximately 0.5 to 2 {\{}micro{\}} in diameter; (b) a microsome fraction composed of submicroscopic elements approximately 80 to 150 m{\{}micro{\}} in diameter; and, (c) a supernate fraction containing the soluble components of the extract.2. The nature and origin of the constituents of liver extract is discussed. The large granule fraction is deemed to consist mostly of mitochondria and liver secretory granules, whereas the microsome fraction corresponds to the chromophilic ground substance of the hepatic cell. Phosphorus distribution in the supernate fraction, and ultraviolet absorption of the solution suggests that practically all the ribose nucleoproteins of liver extract are sedimentable, and occur in association with the large granules and microsomes.3. The method of fractionation of liver suspension by differential centrifugation is being used as a means to investigate the chemical constitution of the morphological constituents of cytoplasm, and the distribution of biochemical activities in the cytoplasm of the hepatic cell.4. The method of differential centrifugation is found to be applicable not only to the fractionation of cells but also, with the aid of auxiliary techniques, to the fractionation of much smaller elements, such as mitochondria.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism of gene regulation. Bisulfite- conversion-based PCR methods, such as bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) and methylation specific PCR (MSP), remain the most commonly used techniques for methylation mapping. Existing primer design programs developed for standard PCR cannot handle primer design for bisulfite-conversion-based PCRs due to changes in DNA sequence context caused by bisulfite treatment and many special constraints both on the primers and the region to be amplified for such experiments. Therefore, the present study was designed to develop a program for such applications. RESULTS MethPrimer, based on Primer 3, is a program for designing PCR primers for methylation mapping. It first takes a DNA sequence as its input and searches the sequence for potential CpG islands. Primers are then picked around the predicted CpG islands or around regions specified by users. MethPrimer can design primers for BSP and MSP. Results of primer selection are delivered through a web browser in text and in graphic view.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli DksA is a transcription factor that binds to RNA polymerase (RNAP) without binding to DNA, destabilizing RNAP-promoter interactions, sensitizing RNAP to the global regulator ppGpp, and regulating transcription of several hundred target genes, including those encoding rRNA. Previously, we described promoter sequences and kinetic properties that account for DksA's promoter specificity, but how DksA exerts its effects on RNAP has remained unclear. To better understand DksA's mechanism of action, we incorporated benzoyl-phenylalanine at specific positions in DksA and mapped its cross-links to RNAP, constraining computational docking of the two proteins. The resulting evidence-based model of the DksA-RNAP complex as well as additional genetic and biochemical approaches confirmed that DksA binds to the RNAP secondary channel, defined the orientation of DksA in the channel, and predicted a network of DksA interactions with RNAP that includes the rim helices and the mobile trigger loop (TL) domain. Engineered cysteine substitutions in the TL and DksA coiled-coil tip generated a disulfide bond between them, and the interacting residues were absolutely required for DksA function. We suggest that DksA traps the TL in a conformation that destabilizes promoter complexes, an interaction explaining the requirement for the DksA tip and its effects on transcription.},

abstract = {The type I keratin 17 (K17) shows a peculiar localization in human epithelial appendages including hair follicles, which undergo a growth cycle throughout adult life. Additionally K17 is induced, along with K6 and K16, early after acute injury to human skin. To gain further insights into its potential function(s), we cloned the mouse K17 gene and investigated its expression during skin development. Synthesis of K17 protein first occurs in a subset of epithelial cells within the single-layered, undifferentiated ectoderm of embryonic day 10.5 mouse fetuses. In the ensuing 48 h, K17-expressing cells give rise to placodes, the precursors of ectoderm-derived appendages (hair, glands, and tooth), and to periderm. During early development, there is a spatial correspondence in the distribution of K17 and that of lymphoid-enhancer factor (lef-1), a DNA-bending protein involved in inductive epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. We demonstrate that ectopic lef-1 expression induces K17 protein in the skin of adult transgenic mice. The pattern of K17 gene expression during development has direct implications for the morphogenesis of skin epithelia, and points to the existence of a molecular relationship between development and wound repair.},

abstract = {TET2 is a close relative of TET1, an enzyme that converts 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in DNA. The gene encoding TET2 resides at chromosome 4q24, in a region showing recurrent microdeletions and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH) in patients with diverse myeloid malignancies. Somatic TET2 mutations are frequently observed in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), MDS/MPN overlap syndromes including chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML), acute myeloid leukaemias (AML) and secondary AML (sAML). We show here that TET2 mutations associated with myeloid malignancies compromise catalytic activity. Bone marrow samples from patients with TET2 mutations displayed uniformly low levels of 5hmC in genomic DNA compared to bone marrow samples from healthy controls. Moreover, small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated depletion of Tet2 in mouse haematopoietic precursors skewed their differentiation towards monocyte/macrophage lineages in culture. There was no significant difference in DNA methylation between bone marrow samples from patients with high 5hmC versus healthy controls, but samples from patients with low 5hmC showed hypomethylation relative to controls at the majority of differentially methylated CpG sites. Our results demonstrate that Tet2 is important for normal myelopoiesis, and suggest that disruption of TET2 enzymatic activity favours myeloid tumorigenesis. Measurement of 5hmC levels in myeloid malignancies may prove valuable as a diagnostic and prognostic tool, to tailor therapies and assess responses to anticancer drugs. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Channel proteins have evolved such that they can be directly stretched open when the membrane is under turgor pressure. Osmotic downshock, as in rain, opens bacterial mechanosensitive (MS) channels to jettison osmolytes, relieving pressure and preventing cell lysis. The ion flux through individual channel proteins can be observed directly with a patch clamp. MS channels of large and small conductance (MscL and MscS, respectively) have been cloned, crystallized, and subjected to biophysical and genetic analyses in depth. They are now models to scrutinize how membrane forces direct protein conformational changes. Eukaryotic microbes have homologs from animal sensory channels of the TRP superfamily. The MS channel in yeast is also directly sensitive to membrane stretch. This review examines the key concept that proteins embedded in the lipid bilayer can respond to the changes in the mechanical environment the lipid bilayer provides.},

DNA concentration in the normal controls had a range of 0 to 100 ng/ml with a mean of 13 +/- 3 ng/ml (S.E.). For comparison purposes, the range of 0 to 50 ng/ml was designated as normal, and 93{\%} of controls were found in this range. In the cancer patients, the DNA concentration ranged from zero to mug levels with a mean of 180 +/- 38 ng/ml. Fifty {\%} of the patients values were found in the range of 0 to 50 ng/ml; the other 50{\%} were between 50 and 5000 ng/ml. No correlation could be seen between DNA levels and the size or location of the primary tumor. Significantly higher DNA levels, however, were found in the serum of patients with metastatic disease (mean of 209 +/- 39 ng/ml), as compared to nonmetastatic patients (mean 100 +/- 30, p less than 0.02). After radiation therapy in lymphoma, lung, ovary, uterus, and cervical tumors, the levels decreased in 66 to 90{\%} of the patients, whereas in glioma, breast, colon, and rectal tumors, the DNA levels decreased only in 16 to 33{\%} of the patients. Generally, the decrease in DNA concene of tumor size and reduction of pain. Conversely, when DNA levels either increased or remained unchanged, a lack of response to the treatment was noted. Of 17 patients who died within a year, 13 showed DNA levels that remained high or unchanged, whereas only 4 showed lower levels during treatment. Persistent high or increasing DNA levels in the circulation, therefore, may signal a relapse and are probably a poor prognostic sign. The relatively high percentage (50{\%}) of cancer patients with apparently normal DNA levels would suggest that this test may have low diagnostic value. It should be pointed out, however, that all these patients represent a selected group considered for radiation therapy, usually after surgery and/or chemotherapy. It is possible that a better correlation between DNA levels and cancer will be obtained prior to the initiation of treatment. On the other hand, DNA in the serum may be an important tool for the evaluation of therapy or the comparison of different regimens.},

@article{Wagner2019,
abstract = {Replicative senescence of cells in vitro is often considered as counterpart for aging of the organism in vivo. In fact, both processes are associated with functional decay and similar molecular modifications. On epigenetic level, replicative senescence and aging evoke characteristic modifications in the DNA methylation (DNAm) pattern, but at different sites in the genome. Various epigenetic signatures, which are often referred to as epigenetic clocks, provide useful biomarkers: Senescence-associated epigenetic modifications can be used for quality control of cell preparations or to elucidate effects of culture conditions on the state of cellular aging. Age-associated epigenetic modifications hold high expectations to determine chronological age in forensics or to identify parameters that impact on biological aging. Despite these differences, there are some striking similarities between senescence- and age-associated DNAm, such as complete rejuvenation during reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). It is yet unclear what makes epigenetic clocks tick, but there is evidence that the underlying mechanisms of both processes are related to similar modifications in the histone code or higher order chromatin. Replicative senescence therefore appears to be a suitable model system to gain better insight into how organismal aging might be governed epigenetically.},

Recent studies have identified collections of individual methylation sites whose aggregate methylation status measures chronological age, referred to as the DNA methylation clock. DNA methylation may also have value as a biomarker of healthy versus unhealthy aging and disease risk; in other words, a biological clock. Here we consider the relationship between the chronological and biological clocks, their underlying mechanisms, potential consequences, and their utility as biomarkers and as targets for intervention to promote healthy aging and longevity. Analysis of age-associated methylation changes at CpG sites has allowed the construction of DNA methylation clocks. Field et al. discuss the potential causes and consequences of these clocks. Comparisons between biological and chronological methylation clocks suggest routes toward their effective application in the treatment and prevention of age-associated disease.},

abstract = {High-throughput RNA sequencing has accelerated discovery of the complex regulatory roles of small RNAs, but RNAs containing modified nucleosides may escape detection when those modifications interfere with reverse transcription during RNA-seq library preparation. Here we describe AlkB-facilitated RNA methylation sequencing (ARM-seq), which uses pretreatment with Escherichia coli AlkB to demethylate N(1)-methyladenosine (m(1)A), N(3)-methylcytidine (m(3)C) and N(1)-methylguanosine (m(1)G), all commonly found in tRNAs. Comparative methylation analysis using ARM-seq provides the first detailed, transcriptome-scale map of these modifications and reveals an abundance of previously undetected, methylated small RNAs derived from tRNAs. ARM-seq demonstrates that tRNA fragments accurately recapitulate the m(1)A modification state for well-characterized yeast tRNAs and generates new predictions for a large number of human tRNAs, including tRNA precursors and mitochondrial tRNAs. Thus, ARM-seq provides broad utility for identifying previously overlooked methyl-modified RNAs, can efficiently monitor methylation state and may reveal new roles for tRNA fragments as biomarkers or signaling molecules.},

While most bacteria move by using specialized appendages, usually external or periplasmic flagella, some bacteria use other mechanisms for their movements that are less well characterized. These mechanisms do not always exhibit obvious motility structures. Myxococcus xanthus is a motile bacterium that does not produce flagella but glides slowly over solid surfaces. How M. xanthus moves has remained a puzzle that has challenged microbiologists for over 50 years. Fortunately, recent advances in the analysis of motility mutants, bioinformatics, and protein localization have revealed likely mechanisms for the two M. xanthus motility systems. These results are summarized in this review.},

abstract = {The Bdellovibrio are miniature "living antibiotic" predatory bacteria which invade, reseal, and digest other larger Gram-negative bacteria, including pathogens. Nutrients for the replication of Bdellovibrio bacteria come entirely from the digestion of the single invaded bacterium, now called a bdelloplast, which is bound by the original prey outer membrane. Bdellovibrio bacteria are efficient digesters of prey cells, yielding on average 4 to 6 progeny from digestion of a single prey cell of a genome size similar to that of the Bdellovibrio cell itself. The developmental intrabacterial cycle of Bdellovibrio is largely unknown and has never been visualized "live." Using the latest motorized xy stage with a very defined z-axis control and engineered periplasmically fluorescent prey allows, for the first time, accurate return and visualization without prey bleaching of developing Bdellovibrio cells using solely the inner resources of a prey cell over several hours. We show that Bdellovibrio bacteria do not follow the familiar pattern of bacterial cell division by binary fission. Instead, they septate synchronously to produce both odd and even numbers of progeny, even when two separate Bdellovibrio cells have invaded and develop within a single prey bacterium, producing two different amounts of progeny. Evolution of this novel septation pattern, allowing odd progeny yields, allows optimal use of the finite prey cell resources to produce maximal replicated, predatory bacteria. When replication is complete, Bdellovibrio cells exit the exhausted prey and are seen leaving via discrete pores rather than by breakdown of the entire outer membrane of the prey.},

However, our understanding of the prevalence of this modification has been fundamentally redefined by transcriptome-wide m(6)A mapping studies, which have shown that m(6)A is present in a large subset of the transcriptome in specific regions of mRNA. This suggests that mRNA may undergo post-transcriptional methylation to regulate its fate and function, which is analogous to methyl modifications in DNA. Thus, the pattern of methylation constitutes an mRNA 'epitranscriptome'. The identification of adenosine methyltransferases ('writers'), m(6)A demethylating enzymes ('erasers') and m(6)A-binding proteins ('readers') is helping to define cellular pathways for the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs.},

This produced a complete failure of placode formation prior to morphological or molecular signs of differentiation, and blocked tooth and mammary gland development before the bud stage. This phenotype indicates that activation of WNT signaling in the skin precedes, and is required for, localized expression of regulatory genes and initiation of hair follicle placode formation.},

abstract = {Ageing in divergent animal phyla is influenced by several evolutionarily conserved signalling pathways, mitochondrial activity and various environmental factors such as nutrient availability and temperature. Although ageing is a multifactorial process with many mechanisms contributing to the decline, the intracellular accumulation of damaged proteins and mitochondria is a feature common to all aged cells. Autophagy (cellular self-eating) - a lysosome-mediated catabolic process of eukaryotic cells to digest their own constituents - is a major route for the bulk degradation of aberrant cytosolic macromolecules and organelles. Indeed, genetic studies show that autophagy-related genes are required for lifespan extension in various long-lived mutant nematodes and promote survival in worms and flies exposed to prolonged starvation. These data implicate autophagy in ageing control. Furthermore, results in Drosophila demonstrate that promoting basal expression of the autophagy gene Atg8 in the nervous system extends lifespan by 50{\%}, thereby providing evidence that the autophagy pathway regulates the rate at which the tissues age. In this review, the molecular mechanisms by which autophagy genes interact with longevity pathways in diverse organisms ranging from yeast to mammals are discussed.},

abstract = {Background: Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) is becoming an increasingly accessible technique, used widely for both fundamental and disease-oriented research. Library preparation methods benefit from a variety of available kits, polymerases and bisulfite conversion protocols. Although some steps in the procedure, such as PCR amplification, are known to introduce biases, a systematic evaluation of biases in WGBS strategies is missing. Results: We perform a comparative analysis of several commonly used pre- and post-bisulfite WGBS library preparation protocols for their performance and quality of sequencing outputs. Our results show that bisulfite conversion per se is the main trigger of pronounced sequencing biases, and PCR amplification builds on these underlying artefacts. The majority of standard library preparation methods yield a significantly biased sequence output and overestimate global methylation. Importantly, both absolute and relative methylation levels at specific genomic regions vary substantially between methods, with clear implications for DNA methylation studies. Conclusions: We show that amplification-free library preparation is the least biased approach for WGBS. In protocols with amplification, the choice of bisulfite conversion protocol or polymerase can significantly minimize artefacts. To aid with the quality assessment of existing WGBS datasets, we have integrated a bias diagnostic tool in the Bismark package and offer several approaches for consideration during the preparation and analysis of WGBS datasets.},

abstract = {Obesity is a global epidemic that is causally associated with a range of diseases, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, at the population-level. However, there is marked heterogeneity in obesity-related outcomes among individuals. This might reflect genotype-dependent responses to adiposity. Given that adiposity, measured by BMI, is associated with widespread changes in gene expression and regulatory variants mediate the majority of known complex trait loci, we sought to identify gene-by-BMI (G × BMI) interactions on the regulation of gene expression in a multi-tissue RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) dataset from the TwinsUK cohort (n = 856). At a false discovery rate of 5{\%}, we identified 16 cis G × BMI interactions (top cis interaction: CHURC1, rs7143432, p = 2.0 × 10(-12)) and one variant regulating 53 genes in trans (top trans interaction: ZNF423, rs3851570, p = 8.2 × 10(-13)), all in adipose tissue. The interactions were adipose-specific and enriched for variants overlapping adipocyte enhancers, and regulated genes were enriched for metabolic and inflammatory processes. We replicated a subset of the interactions in an independent adipose RNA-seq dataset (deCODE genetics, n = 754). We also confirmed the interactions with an alternate measure of obesity, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-derived visceral-fat-volume measurements, in a subset of TwinsUK individuals (n = 682). The identified G × BMI regulatory effects demonstrate the dynamic nature of gene regulation and reveal a functional mechanism underlying the heterogeneous response to obesity. Additionally, we have provided a web browser allowing interactive exploration of the dataset, including of association between expression, BMI, and G × BMI regulatory effects in four tissues.},

abstract = {Overproduction of soluble and stable proteins for functional and structural studies is a major bottleneck for structural genomics programs and traditional biochemistry laboratories. Many high-payoff proteins that are important in various biological processes are "difficult to handle" as protein reagents in their native form. We have recently made several advances in enabling biochemical technologies for improving protein stability (http://www.lanl.gov/projects/gfp/), allowing stratagems for efficient protein domain trapping, solubility-improving mutations, and finding protein folding partners. In particular split-GFP protein tags are a very powerful tool for detection of stable protein domains. Soluble, stable proteins tagged with the 15 amino acid GFP fragment (amino acids 216-228) can be detected in vivo and in vitro using the engineered GFP 1-10 "detector" fragment (amino acids 1-215). If the small tag is accessible, the detector fragment spontaneously binds resulting in fluorescence. Here, we describe our current and on-going efforts to move this process from the bench (manual sample manipulation) to an automated, high-throughput, liquid-handling platform. We discuss optimization and validation of bacterial culture growth, lysis protocols, protein extraction, and assays of soluble and insoluble protein in multiple 96 well plate format. The optimized liquid-handling protocol can be used for rapid determination of the optimal, compact domains from single ORFS, collections of ORFS, or cDNA libraries.},

Given the direct exposure of buccal cells to potent carcinogens such as smoke, epigenetic changes in these cells may provide insights into the development of smoke-related cancers.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: To perform an EWAS in buccal and blood cells to assess the relative effect of smoking on the DNA methylation (DNAme) patterns in these cell types and to test whether these DNAme changes are also seen in epithelial cancer.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In 2013, we measured DNAme at more than 480,000 CpG sites in buccal samples provided in 1999 by 790 women (all aged 53 years in 1999) from the United Kingdom Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development. This included matched blood samples from 152 women. We constructed a DNAme-based smoking index and tested its sensitivity and specificity to discriminate normal from cancer tissue in more than 5000 samples.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: CpG sites whose DNAme level correlates with smoking pack-years, and construction of an associated sample-specific smoking index, which measures the mean deviation of DNAme at smoking-associated CpG sites from a normal reference.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In a discovery set of 400 women, we identified 1501 smoking-associated CpG sites at a genome-wide significance level of P {\textless} 10-7, which were validated in an independent set of 390 women. This represented a 40-fold increase of differentially methylated sites in buccal cells compared with matched blood samples. Hypermethylated sites were enriched for bivalently marked genes and binding sites of transcription factors implicated in DNA repair and chromatin architecture (P {\textless} 10-10). A smoking index constructed from the DNAme changes in buccal cells was able to discriminate normal tissue from cancer tissue with a mean receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.99 (range, 0.99-1.00) for lung cancers and of 0.91 (range, 0.71-1.00) for 13 other organs. The corresponding area under the curve of a smoking signature derived from blood cells was lower than that derived from buccal cells in 14 of 15 cancer types (Wilcoxon signed rank test, P = .001).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These data point toward buccal cells as being a more appropriate source of tissue than blood to conduct EWASs for smoking-related epithelial cancers.},

abstract = {Circular RNA forms had been described in all domains of life. Such RNAs were shown to have diverse biological functions, including roles in the life cycle of viral and viroid genomes, and in maturation of permuted tRNA genes. Despite their potentially important biological roles, discovery of circular RNAs has so far been mostly serendipitous. We have developed circRNA-seq, a combined experimental/computational approach that enriches for circular RNAs and allows profiling their prevalence in a whole-genome, unbiased manner. Application of this approach to the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 revealed multiple circular transcripts, a subset of which was further validated independently. The identified circular RNAs included expected forms, such as excised tRNA introns and rRNA processing intermediates, but were also enriched with non-coding RNAs, including C/D box RNAs and RNase P, as well as circular RNAs of unknown function. Many of the identified circles were conserved in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, further supporting their functional significance. Our results suggest that circular RNAs, and particularly circular non-coding RNAs, are more prevalent in archaea than previously recognized, and might have yet unidentified biological roles. Our study establishes a specific and sensitive approach for identification of circular RNAs using RNA-seq, and can readily be applied to other organisms.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Development of sequencing technologies and supporting computation enable discovery of small RNA molecules that previously escaped detection or were ignored due to low count numbers. While the focus in the analysis of small RNA libraries has been primarily on microRNAs (miRNAs), recent studies have reported findings of fragments of transfer RNAs (tRFs) across a range of organisms. RESULTS Here we describe Drosophila melanogaster tRFs, which appear to have a number of structural and functional features similar to those of miRNAs but are less abundant. As is the case with miRNAs, (i) tRFs seem to have distinct isoforms preferentially originating from 5' or 3' end of a precursor molecule (in this case, tRNA), (ii) ends of tRFs appear to contain short "seed" sequences matching conserved regions across 12 Drosophila genomes, preferentially in 3' UTRs but also in introns and exons; (iii) tRFs display specific isoform loading into Ago1 and Ago2 and thus likely function in RISC complexes; (iii) levels of loading in Ago1 and Ago2 differ considerably; and (iv) both tRF expression and loading appear to be age-dependent, indicating potential regulatory changes from young to adult organisms. CONCLUSIONS We found that Drosophila tRF reads mapped to both nuclear and mitochondrial tRNA genes for all 20 amino acids, while previous studies have usually reported fragments from only a few tRNAs. These tRFs show a number of similarities with miRNAs, including seed sequences. Based on complementarity with conserved Drosophila regions we identified such seed sequences and their possible targets with matches in the 3'UTR regions. Strikingly, the potential target genes of the most abundant tRFs show significant Gene Ontology enrichment in development and neuronal function. The latter suggests that involvement of tRFs in the RNA interfering pathway may play a role in brain activity or brain changes with age.},

This deterioration is the primary risk factor for major human pathologies, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Aging research has experienced an unprecedented advance over recent years, particularly with the discovery that the rate of aging is controlled, at least to some extent, by genetic pathways and biochemical processes conserved in evolution. This Review enumerates nine tentative hallmarks that represent common denominators of aging in different organisms, with special emphasis on mammalian aging. These hallmarks are: genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication. A major challenge is to dissect the interconnectedness between the candidate hallmarks and their relative contributions to aging, with the final goal of identifying pharmaceutical targets to improve human health during aging, with minimal side effects.},

The recent discovery that FTO, an obesity risk gene, encodes an m(6)A demethylase implicates m(6)A as an important regulator of physiological processes. Here, we present a method for transcriptome-wide m(6)A localization, which combines m(6)A-specific methylated RNA immunoprecipitation with next-generation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq). We use this method to identify mRNAs of 7,676 mammalian genes that contain m(6)A, indicating that m(6)A is a common base modification of mRNA. The m(6)A modification exhibits tissue-specific regulation and is markedly increased throughout brain development. We find that m(6)A sites are enriched near stop codons and in 3' UTRs, and we uncover an association between m(6)A residues and microRNA-binding sites within 3' UTRs. These findings provide a resource for identifying transcripts that are substrates for adenosine methylation and reveal insights into the epigenetic regulation of the mammalian transcriptome.},

Here we show that Maf1, a repressor of RNA polymerase III-dependent tRNA transcription, is an important mediator of nutrient-dependent growth in Drosophila. We find nutrients promote tRNA synthesis during larval development by inhibiting Maf1. Genetic inhibition of Maf1 accelerates development and increases body size. These phenotypes are due to a non-cell-autonomous effect of Maf1 inhibition in the fat body, the main larval endocrine organ. Inhibiting Maf1 in the fat body increases growth by promoting the expression of brain-derived insulin-like peptides and consequently enhanced systemic insulin signaling. Remarkably, the effects of Maf1 inhibition are reproduced in flies carrying one extra copy of the initiator methionine tRNA, tRNA(i)(Met). These findings suggest the stimulation of tRNA(i)(Met) synthesis via inhibition of dMaf1 is limiting for nutrition-dependent growth during development.},

abstract = {Background. Technological advances in high throughput DNA methylation microarrays have allowed dramatic growth of a new branch of epigenetic epidemiology. DNA methylation datasets are growing ever larger in terms of the number of samples profiled, the extent of genome coverage, and the number of studies being meta-analysed. Novel computational solutions are required to efficiently handle these data. Methods. We have developed meffil, an R package designed to quality control, normalize and perform epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) efficiently on large samples of Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 and MethylationEPIC BeadChip microarrays. We tested meffil by applying it to 6000 450k microarrays generated from blood collected for two different datasets. Results. A complete reimplementation of functional normalization minimizes computational memory requirements to 5{\%} of that required by other R packages, without increasing running time. Incorporating fixed and random fixed effects alongside functional normalization, and automated estimation of functional normalisation parameters reduces technical variation in DNA methylation levels, thus reducing false positive associations and improving power. We also demonstrate that the ability to normalize datasets distributed across physically different locations without sharing any biologically-based individual-level data may reduce heterogeneity in meta-analyses of epigenome-wide association studies. However, when batch is perfectly confounded with cases and controls functional normalization is unable to prevent spurious associations. Conclusions. meffil is available online (https://github.com/perishky/meffil/) along with tutorials covering typical use cases.},

abstract = {The species-specific diversity of codon usage in five eukaryotes (Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Xenopus laevis, and Homo sapiens) was investigated with principal component analysis. Optimal codons for translation were predicted on the basis of tRNA-gene copy numbers. Highly expressed genes, such as those encoding ribosomal proteins and histones in S. pombe, C. elegans, and D. melanogaster, have biased patterns of codon usage which have been observed in a wide range of unicellular organisms. In S. pombe and C. elegans, codons contributing positively to the principal component with the largest variance (Z1-parameter) corresponded to the optimal codons which were predicted on the basis of tRNA gene numbers. In D. melanogaster, this correlation was less evident, and the codons contributing positively to the Z1-parameter corresponded primarily to codons with a C or G in the codon third position. In X. laevis and H. sapiens, codon usage in the genes encoding ribosomal proteins and histones was not significantly biased, suggesting that the primary factor influencing codon-usage diversity in these species is not translation efficiency. Codon-usage diversity in these species is known to reflect primarily isochore structures. In the present study, the second additional factor was explained by the level of use of codons containing CG-dinucleotides, and this is discussed with respect to transcription regulation via methylation of CG-dinucleotides, which is observed in mammalian genomes.},

abstract = {Crystal structures of the Lac repressor, with and without isopropyithiogalactoside (IPTG), and the repressor bound to operator have provided a model for how the binding of the inducer reduces the affinity of the repressor for the operator. However, because of the low resolution of the operator-bound structure (4.8 A), the model for the allosteric transition was presented in terms of structural elements rather than in terms of side chain interactions. Here we have constructed a dimeric Lac repressor and determined its structure at 2.6 A resolution in complex with a symmetric operator and the anti-inducer orthonitrophenylfucoside (ONPF). The structure enables the induced (IPTG-bound) and repressed (operator-bound) conformations of the repressor to be compared in atomic detail. An extensive network of interactions between the DNA-binding and core domains of the repressor suggests a possible mechanism for the allosteric transition.},

Surveys of DNA methylation in human tissues have established a complex landscape including both tissue-specific and invariant methylation patterns. Here we report high coverage methylomes that catalogue cytosine methylation in all contexts for the major human organ systems, integrated with matched transcriptomes and genomic sequence. By combining these diverse data types with each individuals' phased genome, we identified widespread tissue-specific differential CG methylation (mCG), partially methylated domains, allele-specific methylation and transcription, and the unexpected presence of non-CG methylation (mCH) in almost all human tissues. mCH correlated with tissue-specific functions, and using this mark, we made novel predictions of genes that escape X-chromosome inactivation in specific tissues. Overall, DNA methylation in several genomic contexts varies substantially among human tissues.},

abstract = {Mammalian genomes are spatially organized by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin into chromatin loops and topologically associated domains, which have important roles in gene regulation and recombination. By binding to specific sequences, CTCF defines contact points for cohesin-mediated long-range chromosomal cis-interactions. Cohesin is also present at these sites, but has been proposed to be loaded onto DNA elsewhere and to extrude chromatin loops until it encounters CTCF bound to DNA. How cohesin is recruited to CTCF sites, according to this or other models, is unknown. Here we show that the distribution of cohesin in the mouse genome depends on transcription, CTCF and the cohesin release factor Wings apart-like (Wapl). In CTCF-depleted fibroblasts, cohesin cannot be properly recruited to CTCF sites but instead accumulates at transcription start sites of active genes, where the cohesin-loading complex is located. In the absence of both CTCF and Wapl, cohesin accumulates in up to 70 kilobase-long regions at 3'-ends of active genes, in particular if these converge on each other. Changing gene expression modulates the position of these 'cohesin islands'. These findings indicate that transcription can relocate mammalian cohesin over long distances on DNA, as previously reported for yeast cohesin, that this translocation contributes to positioning cohesin at CTCF sites, and that active genes can be freed from cohesin either by transcription-mediated translocation or by Wapl-mediated release.},

Mechanisms underlying these age-related defects remain largely unknown. We show that the deacetylase Sirtuin (SIRT)1 is required for homeostatic HSC maintenance. Differentiation of young SIRT1-deleted HSCs is skewed toward myeloid lineage associated with a significant decline in the lymphoid compartment, anemia, and altered expression of associated genes. Combined with HSC accumulation of damaged DNA and expression patterns of age-linked molecules, these have striking overlaps with aged HSCs. We further show that SIRT1 controls HSC homeostasis via the longevity transcription factor FOXO3. These findings suggest that SIRT1 is essential for HSC homeostasis and lineage specification. They also indicate that SIRT1 might contribute to delaying HSC aging.},

abstract = {Mutations in the cytosine-5 RNA methyltransferase NSun2 cause microcephaly and other neurological abnormalities in mice and human. How post-transcriptional methylation contributes to the human disease is currently unknown. By comparing gene expression data with global cytosine-5 RNA methylomes in patient fibroblasts and NSun2-deficient mice, we find that loss of cytosine-5 RNA methylation increases the angiogenin-mediated endonucleolytic cleavage of transfer RNAs (tRNA) leading to an accumulation of 5' tRNA-derived small RNA fragments. Accumulation of 5' tRNA fragments in the absence of NSun2 reduces protein translation rates and activates stress pathways leading to reduced cell size and increased apoptosis of cortical, hippocampal and striatal neurons. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that angiogenin binds with higher affinity to tRNAs lacking site-specific NSun2-mediated methylation and that the presence of 5' tRNA fragments is sufficient and required to trigger cellular stress responses. Furthermore, the enhanced sensitivity of NSun2-deficient brains to oxidative stress can be rescued through inhibition of angiogenin during embryogenesis. In conclusion, failure in NSun2-mediated tRNA methylation contributes to human diseases via stress-induced RNA cleavage.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, most amino acids can be encoded by multiple synonymous codons. Synonymous codons naturally occur with different frequencies in different organisms. The choice of codons may affect protein expression, structure, and function. Recombinant gene technologies commonly take advantage of the former effect by implementing a technique termed codon optimization, in which codons are replaced with synonymous ones in order to increase protein expression. This technique relies on the accurate knowledge of codon usage frequencies. Accurately quantifying codon usage bias for different organisms is useful not only for codon optimization, but also for evolutionary and translation studies: phylogenetic relations of organisms, and host-pathogen co-evolution relationships, may be explored through their codon usage similarities. Furthermore, codon usage has been shown to affect protein structure and function through interfering with translation kinetics, and cotranslational protein folding. RESULTS Despite the obvious need for accurate codon usage tables, currently available resources are either limited in scope, encompassing only organisms from specific domains of life, or greatly outdated. Taking advantage of the exponential growth of GenBank and the creation of NCBI's RefSeq database, we have developed a new database, the High-performance Integrated Virtual Environment-Codon Usage Tables (HIVE-CUTs), to present and analyse codon usage tables for every organism with publicly available sequencing data. Compared to existing databases, this new database is more comprehensive, addresses concerns that limited the accuracy of earlier databases, and provides several new functionalities, such as the ability to view and compare codon usage between individual organisms and across taxonomical clades, through graphical representation or through commonly used indices. In addition, it is being routinely updated to keep up with the continuous flow of new data in GenBank and RefSeq. CONCLUSION Given the impact of codon usage bias on recombinant gene technologies, this database will facilitate effective development and review of recombinant drug products and will be instrumental in a wide area of biological research. The database is available at hive.biochemistry.gwu.edu/review/codon .},

Autophagosomal dysfunction has been implicated in an increasing number of diseases from cancer to bacterial and viral infections and more recently in neurodegeneration. While a decrease in autophagic activity appears to interfere with protein degradation and possibly organelle turnover, increased autophagy has been shown to facilitate the clearance of aggregation-prone proteins and promote neuronal survival in a number of disease models. On the other hand, too much autophagic activity can be detrimental as well and lead to cell death, suggesting the regulation of autophagy has an important role in cell fate decisions. An increasing number of model systems are now available to study the role of autophagy in the central nervous system and how it might be exploited to treat disease. We will review here the current knowledge of autophagy in the central nervous system and provide an overview of the various models that have been used to study acute and chronic neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Human aging is associated with DNA methylation changes at specific sites in the genome. These epigenetic modifications may be used to track donor age for forensic analysis or to estimate biological age. RESULTS We perform a comprehensive analysis of methylation profiles to narrow down 102 age-related CpG sites in blood. We demonstrate that most of these age-associated methylation changes are reversed in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Methylation levels at three age-related CpGs--located in the genes ITGA2B, ASPA and PDE4C--were subsequently analyzed by bisulfite pyrosequencing of 151 blood samples. This epigenetic aging signature facilitates age predictions with a mean absolute deviation from chronological age of less than 5 years. This precision is higher than age predictions based on telomere length. Variation of age predictions correlates moderately with clinical and lifestyle parameters supporting the notion that age-associated methylation changes are associated more with biological age than with chronological age. Furthermore, patients with acquired aplastic anemia or dyskeratosis congenita--two diseases associated with progressive bone marrow failure and severe telomere attrition--are predicted to be prematurely aged. CONCLUSIONS Our epigenetic aging signature provides a simple biomarker to estimate the state of aging in blood. Age-associated DNA methylation changes are counteracted in iPSCs. On the other hand, over-estimation of chronological age in bone marrow failure syndromes is indicative for exhaustion of the hematopoietic cell pool. Thus, epigenetic changes upon aging seem to reflect biological aging of blood.},

abstract = {Here, we propose a new approach to defining nerve “cell types” in reaction to recent advances in single cell analysis. Among cells previously thought to be equivalent, considerable differences in global gene expression and biased tendencies among differing developmental fates have been demonstrated within multiple lineages. The model of classifying cells into distinct types thus has to be revised to account for this intrinsic variability. A “cell type” could be a group of cells that possess similar, but not necessarily identical properties, variable within a spectrum of epigenetic adjustments that permit its developmental path toward a specific function to be achieved. Thus, the definition of a cell type is becoming more similar to the definition of a species: sharing essential properties with other members of its group, but permitting a certain amount of deviation in aspects that do not seriously impact function. This approach accommodates, even embraces the spectrum of natural variation found in various cell populations and consequently avoids the fallacy of false equivalence. For example, developing neurons will react to their microenvironments with epigenetic changes resulting in slight changes in gene expression and morphology. Addressing the new questions implied here will have significant implications for developmental neurobiology.},

abstract = {We present a fast mapping-based algorithm to compute the mappability of each region of a reference genome up to a specified number of mismatches. Knowing the mappability of a genome is crucial for the interpretation of massively parallel sequencing experiments. We investigate the properties of the mappability of eukaryotic DNA/RNA both as a whole and at the level of the gene family, providing for various organisms tracks which allow the mappability information to be visually explored. In addition, we show that mappability varies greatly between species and gene classes. Finally, we suggest several practical applications where mappability can be used to refine the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data (SNP calling, gene expression quantification and paired-end experiments). This work highlights mappability as an important concept which deserves to be taken into full account, in particular when massively parallel sequencing technologies are employed. The GEM mappability program belongs to the GEM (GEnome Multitool) suite of programs, which can be freely downloaded for any use from its website (http://gemlibrary.sourceforge.net).},

Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach. We present DESeq2, a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates.

abstract = {Genomic biomarkers such as DNA methylation (DNAm) are employed for age prediction. In recent years, several studies have suggested the association between changes in DNAm and its effect on human age. The high dimensional nature of this type of data significantly increases the execution time of modeling algorithms. To mitigate this problem, we propose a two-stage parallel algorithm for selection of age related CpG-sites. The algorithm first attempts to cluster the data into similar age ranges. In the next stage, a parallel genetic algorithm (PGA), based on the MapReduce paradigm (MR-based PGA), is used for selecting age-related features of each individual age range. In the proposed method, the execution of the algorithm for each age range (data parallel), the evaluation of chromosomes (task parallel) and the calculation of the fitness function (data parallel) are performed using a novel parallel framework. In this paper, we consider 16 different healthy DNAm datasets that are related to the human blood tissue and that contain the relevant age information. These datasets are combined into a single unioned set, which is in turn randomly divided into two sets of train and test data with a ratio of 7:3, respectively. We build a Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) model on the selected CpG-sites from the train set. To evaluate the model accuracy, we compared our results with state-of-the-art approaches that used these datasets, and observed that our method performs better on the unseen test dataset with a Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of 3.62 years, and a correlation (R2) of 95.96{\%} between age and DNAm. In the train data, the MAD and R2 are 1.27 years and 99.27{\%}, respectively. Finally, we evaluate our method in terms of the effect of parallelization in computation time. The algorithm without parallelization requires 4123 min to complete, whereas the parallelized execution on 3 computing machines having 32 processing cores each, only takes a total of 58 min. This shows that our proposed algorithm is both efficient and scalable.},

Despite low sequence identities between different forms (about 15–30{\%}), the 3D structures display highly similar $\alpha$/$\beta$ folding patterns with a central $\beta$-sheet, typical of the Rossmann-fold. Based on distinct sequence motifs functional assignments and classifications are possible, making it possible to build a general nomenclature system. Recent mutagenetic and structural studies considerably extend the knowledge on the general reaction mechanism, thereby establishing a catalytic tetrad of Asn–Ser–Tyr–Lys residues, which presumably form the framework for a proton relay system including the 2′-OH of the nicotinamide ribose, similar to the mechanism found in horse liver ADH. Based on their cellular functions, several SDR enzymes appear as possible and promising pharmacological targets with application areas spanning hormone-dependent cancer forms or metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes, and infectious diseases.},

abstract = {A number of genome analyses and searches using programs that focus on the RNA-specific bulge-helix-bulge (BHB) motif have uncovered a wide variety of disrupted tRNA genes. The results of these analyses have shown that genetic information encoding functional RNAs is described in the genome cryptically and is retrieved using various strategies. One such strategy is represented by circularly permuted tRNA genes, in which the sequences encoding the 5'-half and 3'-half of the specific tRNA are separated and inverted on the genome. Biochemical analyses have defined a processing pathway in which the termini of tRNA precursors (pre-tRNAs) are ligated to form a characteristic circular RNA intermediate, which is then cleaved at the acceptor-stem to generate the typical cloverleaf structure with functional termini. The sequences adjacent to the processing site located between the 3'-half and the 5'-half of pre-tRNAs potentially form a BHB motif, which is the dominant recognition site for the tRNA-intron splicing endonuclease, suggesting that circularization of pre-tRNAs depends on the splicing machinery. Some permuted tRNAs contain a BHB-mediated intron in their 5'- or 3'-half, meaning that removal of an intron, as well as swapping of the 5'- and 3'-halves, are required during maturation of their pre-tRNAs. To date, 34 permuted tRNA genes have been identified from six species of unicellular algae and one archaeon. Although their physiological significance and mechanism of development remain unclear, the splicing system of BHB motifs seems to have played a key role in the formation of permuted tRNA genes. In this review, current knowledge of circularly permuted tRNA genes is presented and some unanswered questions regarding these species are discussed.},

abstract = {Different environmental stimuli cause bacteria to exchange the sigma subunit in the RNA polymerase (RNAP) and, thereby, tune their gene expression according to the newly emerging needs. Sigma factors are usually thought to recognize clearly distinguishable promoter DNA determinants, and thereby activate distinct gene sets, known as their regulons. In this review, we illustrate how the principle sigma factor in stationary phase and in stressful conditions in Escherichia coli, sigmaS (RpoS), can specifically target its large regulon in vivo, although it is known to recognize the same core promoter elements in vitro as the housekeeping sigma factor, sigma70 (RpoD). Variable combinations of cis-acting promoter features and trans-acting protein factors determine whether a promoter is recognized by RNAP containing sigmaS or sigma70, or by both holoenzymes. How these promoter features impose sigmaS selectivity is further discussed. Moreover, additional pathways allow sigmaS to compete more efficiently than sigma70 for limiting amounts of core RNAP (E) and thereby enhance EsigmaS formation and effectiveness. Finally, these topics are discussed in the context of sigma factor evolution and the benefits a cell gains from retaining competing and closely related sigma factors with overlapping sets of target genes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND We recently showed that enzymes of the TET family convert 5-mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) in DNA. 5-hmC is present at high levels in embryonic stem cells and Purkinje neurons. The methylation status of cytosines is typically assessed by reaction with sodium bisulfite followed by PCR amplification. Reaction with sodium bisulfite promotes cytosine deamination, whereas 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) reacts poorly with bisulfite and is resistant to deamination. Since 5-hmC reacts with bisulfite to yield cytosine 5-methylenesulfonate (CMS), we asked how DNA containing 5-hmC behaves in bisulfite sequencing. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We used synthetic oligonucleotides with different distributions of cytosine as templates for generation of DNAs containing C, 5-mC and 5-hmC. The resulting DNAs were subjected in parallel to bisulfite treatment, followed by exposure to conditions promoting cytosine deamination. The extent of conversion of 5-hmC to CMS was estimated to be 99.7{\%}. Sequencing of PCR products showed that neither 5-mC nor 5-hmC undergo C-to-T transitions after bisulfite treatment, confirming that these two modified cytosine species are indistinguishable by the bisulfite technique. DNA in which CMS constituted a large fraction of all bases (28/201) was much less efficiently amplified than DNA in which those bases were 5-mC or uracil (the latter produced by cytosine deamination). Using a series of primer extension experiments, we traced the inefficient amplification of CMS-containing DNA to stalling of Taq polymerase at sites of CMS modification, especially when two CMS bases were either adjacent to one another or separated by 1-2 nucleotides. CONCLUSIONS We have confirmed that the widely used bisulfite sequencing technique does not distinguish between 5-mC and 5-hmC. Moreover, we show that CMS, the product of bisulfite conversion of 5-hmC, tends to stall DNA polymerases during PCR, suggesting that densely hydroxymethylated regions of DNA may be underrepresented in quantitative methylation analyses.},

abstract = {Background Projections of future mortality and life expectancy are needed to plan for health and social services and pensions. Our aim was to forecast national age-specific mortality and life expectancy using an approach that takes into account the uncertainty related to the choice of forecasting model. Methods We developed an ensemble of 21 forecasting models, all of which probabilistically contributed towards the final projections. We applied this approach to project age-specific mortality to 2030 in 35 industrialised countries with high-quality vital statistics data. We used age-specific death rates to calculate life expectancy at birth and at age 65 years, and probability of dying before age 70 years, with life table methods. Findings Life expectancy is projected to increase in all 35 countries with a probability of at least 65{\%} for women and 85{\%} for men. There is a 90{\%} probability that life expectancy at birth among South Korean women in 2030 will be higher than 86{\textperiodcentered}7 years, the same as the highest worldwide life expectancy in 2012, and a 57{\%} probability that it will be higher than 90 years. Projected female life expectancy in South Korea is followed by those in France, Spain, and Japan. There is a greater than 95{\%} probability that life expectancy at birth among men in South Korea, Australia, and Switzerland will surpass 80 years in 2030, and a greater than 27{\%} probability that it will surpass 85 years. Of the countries studied, the USA, Japan, Sweden, Greece, Macedonia, and Serbia have some of the lowest projected life expectancy gains for both men and women. The female life expectancy advantage over men is likely to shrink by 2030 in every country except Mexico, where female life expectancy is predicted to increase more than male life expectancy, and in Chile, France, and Greece where the two sexes will see similar gains. More than half of the projected gains in life expectancy at birth in women will be due to enhanced longevity above age 65 years. Interpretation There is more than a 50{\%} probability that by 2030, national female life expectancy will break the 90 year barrier, a level that was deemed unattainable by some at the turn of the 21st century. Our projections show continued increases in longevity, and the need for careful planning for health and social services and pensions.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether or not the current evidence base allows definite conclusions to be made regarding the optimal maternal circulating concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] during pregnancy, and how this might best be achieved.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: To answer the following questions: (1) What are the clinical criteria for vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women? (2) What adverse maternal and neonatal health outcomes are associated with low maternal circulating 25(OH)D? (3) Does maternal supplementation with vitamin D in pregnancy lead to an improvement in these outcomes (including assessment of compliance and effectiveness)? (4) What is the optimal type (D2 or D3), dose, regimen and route for vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy? (5) Is supplementation with vitamin D in pregnancy likely to be cost-effective?$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We performed a systematic review and where possible combined study results using meta-analysis to estimate the combined effect size. Major electronic databases [including Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) database] were searched from inception up to June 2012 covering both published and grey literature. Bibliographies of selected papers were hand-searched for additional references. Relevant authors were contacted for any unpublished findings and additional data if necessary. Abstracts were reviewed by two reviewers.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nINCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA: $\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUBJECTS: pregnant women or pregnant women and their offspring.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nEXPOSURE: either assessment of vitamin D status [dietary intake, sunlight exposure, circulating 25(OH)D concentration] or supplementation of participants with vitamin D or food containing vitamin D (e.g. oily fish).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOUTCOMES: offspring - birthweight, birth length, head circumference, bone mass, anthropometry and body composition, risk of asthma and atopy, small for gestational dates, preterm birth, type 1 diabetes mellitus, low birthweight, serum calcium concentration, blood pressure and rickets; mother - pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, risk of caesarean section and bacterial vaginosis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Seventy-six studies were included. There was considerable heterogeneity between the studies and for most outcomes there was conflicting evidence. The evidence base was insufficient to reliably answer question 1 in relation to biochemical or disease outcomes. For questions 2 and 3, modest positive relationships were identified between maternal 25(OH)D and (1) offspring birthweight in meta-analysis of three observational studies using log-transformed 25(OH)D concentrations after adjustment for potential confounding factors [pooled regression coefficient 5.63 g/10{\%} change maternal 25(OH)D, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.11 to 10.16 g], but not in those four studies using natural units, or across intervention studies; (2) offspring cord blood or postnatal calcium concentrations in a meta-analysis of six intervention studies (all found to be at high risk of bias; mean difference 0.05 mmol/l, 95{\%} CI 0.02 to 0.05 mmol/l); and (3) offspring bone mass in observational studies judged to be of good quality, but which did not permit meta-analysis. The evidence base was insufficient to reliably answer questions 4 and 5.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLIMITATIONS: Study methodology varied widely in terms of study design, population used, vitamin D status assessment, exposure measured and outcome definition.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The evidence base is currently insufficient to support definite clinical recommendations regarding vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy. Although there is modest evidence to support a relationship between maternal 25(OH)D status and offspring birthweight, bone mass and serum calcium concentrations, these findings were limited by their observational nature (birthweight, bone mass) or risk of bias and low quality (calcium concentrations). High-quality randomised trials are now required.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSTUDY REGISTRATION: This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42011001426.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFUNDING: The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme.},

abstract = {It is becoming increasingly apparent that the risk of developing osteoporosis is accrued throughout the entire lifecourse, even from as early as conception. Thus early growth is associated with bone mass at peak and in older age, and risk of hip fracture. Novel findings from mother-offspring cohorts have yielded greater understanding of relationships between patterns of intrauterine and postnatal growth in the context of later bone development. Study of biological samples from these populations has helped characterize potential mechanistic underpinnings, such as epigenetic processes. Global policy has recognized the importance of early growth and nutrition to the risk of developing adult chronic noncommunicable diseases such as osteoporosis; testing of pregnancy interventions aimed at optimizing offspring bone health is now underway. It is hoped that through such programs, novel public health strategies may be established with the ultimate goal of reducing the burden of osteoporotic fracture in older age.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The pervasive expression of circular RNA is a recently discovered feature of gene expression in highly diverged eukaryotes, but the functions of most circular RNAs are still unknown. Computational methods to discover and quantify circular RNA are essential. Moreover, discovering biological contexts where circular RNAs are regulated will shed light on potential functional roles they may play. RESULTS We present a new algorithm that increases the sensitivity and specificity of circular RNA detection by discovering and quantifying circular and linear RNA splicing events at both annotated and un-annotated exon boundaries, including intergenic regions of the genome, with high statistical confidence. Unlike approaches that rely on read count and exon homology to determine confidence in prediction of circular RNA expression, our algorithm uses a statistical approach. Using our algorithm, we unveiled striking induction of general and tissue-specific circular RNAs, including in the heart and lung, during human fetal development. We discover regions of the human fetal brain, such as the frontal cortex, with marked enrichment for genes where circular RNA isoforms are dominant. CONCLUSIONS The vast majority of circular RNA production occurs at major spliceosome splice sites; however, we find the first examples of developmentally induced circular RNAs processed by the minor spliceosome, and an enriched propensity of minor spliceosome donors to splice into circular RNA at un-annotated, rather than annotated, exons. Together, these results suggest a potentially significant role for circular RNA in human development.},

abstract = {CpG islands (CGIs) are vertebrate genomic landmarks that encompass the promoters of most genes and often lack DNA methylation. Querying their apparent importance, the number of CGIs is reported to vary widely in different species and many do not co-localise with annotated promoters. We set out to quantify the number of CGIs in mouse and human genomes using CXXC Affinity Purification plus deep sequencing (CAP-seq). We also asked whether CGIs not associated with annotated transcripts share properties with those at known promoters. We found that, contrary to previous estimates, CGI abundance in humans and mice is very similar and many are at conserved locations relative to genes. In each species CpG density correlates positively with the degree of H3K4 trimethylation, supporting the hypothesis that these two properties are mechanistically interdependent. Approximately half of mammalian CGIs ({\textgreater}10,000) are "orphans" that are not associated with annotated promoters. Many orphan CGIs show evidence of transcriptional initiation and dynamic expression during development. Unlike CGIs at known promoters, orphan CGIs are frequently subject to DNA methylation during development, and this is accompanied by loss of their active promoter features. In colorectal tumors, however, orphan CGIs are not preferentially methylated, suggesting that cancer does not recapitulate a developmental program. Human and mouse genomes have similar numbers of CGIs, over half of which are remote from known promoters. Orphan CGIs nevertheless have the characteristics of functional promoters, though they are much more likely than promoter CGIs to become methylated during development and hence lose these properties. The data indicate that orphan CGIs correspond to previously undetected promoters whose transcriptional activity may play a functional role during development.},

abstract = {The seminal importance of DNA sequencing to the life sciences, biotechnology and medicine has driven the search for more scalable and lower-cost solutions. Here we describe a DNA sequencing technology in which scalable, low-cost semiconductor manufacturing techniques are used to make an integrated circuit able to directly perform non-optical DNA sequencing of genomes. Sequence data are obtained by directly sensing the ions produced by template-directed DNA polymerase synthesis using all-natural nucleotides on this massively parallel semiconductor-sensing device or ion chip. The ion chip contains ion-sensitive, field-effect transistor-based sensors in perfect register with 1.2 million wells, which provide confinement and allow parallel, simultaneous detection of independent sequencing reactions. Use of the most widely used technology for constructing integrated circuits, the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process, allows for low-cost, large-scale production and scaling of the device to higher densities and larger array sizes. We show the performance of the system by sequencing three bacterial genomes, its robustness and scalability by producing ion chips with up to 10 times as many sensors and sequencing a human genome.},

The DBDs have been well characterized, but little is known about the mechanisms by which ADs effect gene activation. Here, we report that diverse ADs form phase-separated condensates with the Mediator coactivator. For the OCT4 and GCN4 TFs, we show that the ability to form phase-separated droplets with Mediator in vitro and the ability to activate genes in vivo are dependent on the same amino acid residues. For the estrogen receptor (ER), a ligand-dependent activator, we show that estrogen enhances phase separation with Mediator, again linking phase separation with gene activation. These results suggest that diverse TFs can interact with Mediator through the phase-separating capacity of their ADs and that formation of condensates with Mediator is involved in gene activation.

It is based on the EADock DSS engine, combined with setup scripts for curating common problems and for preparing both the target protein and the ligand input files. An efficient Ajax/HTML interface was designed and implemented so that scientists can easily submit dockings and retrieve the predicted complexes. For automated docking tasks, a programmatic SOAP interface has been set up and template programs can be downloaded in Perl, Python and PHP. The web site also provides an access to a database of manually curated complexes, based on the Ligand Protein Database. A wiki and a forum are available to the community to promote interactions between users. The SwissDock web site is available online at http://www.swissdock.ch.

abstract = {Circular RNAs are new players in regulation of post transcriptional gene expression. Animal genomes express many circular RNAs from diverse genomic locations. A recent study has validated a fairly large number of circular RNAs in human, mouse, and nematode. Circular RNAs play a crucial role in fine tuning the level of miRNA mediated regulation of gene expression by sequestering the miRNAs. Their interaction with disease associated miRNAs indicates that circular RNAs are important for disease regulation. In this paper we studied the potential association of circular RNAs (circRNA) with human diseases in two different ways. Firstly, the interactions of circRNAs with disease associated miRNAs were identified, following which the likelihood of a circRNA being associated with a disease was calculated. For the miRNAs associated with individual diseases, we constructed a network of predicted interactions between the miRNAs and protein coding, long non-coding and circular RNA genes. We carried out gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on the set of protein coding genes in the miRNA- circRNA interactome of individual diseases to check the enrichment of genes associated with particular biological processes. Secondly, disease associated SNPs were mapped on circRNA loci, and Argonaute (Ago) interaction sites on circular RNAs were identified. We compiled a database of disease-circRNA association in Circ2Traits (http://gyanxet-beta.com/circdb/), the first comprehensive knowledgebase of potential association of circular RNAs with diseases in human.},

C666-1 is a subclone of its parental cell line, C666, derived from an NPC xenograft of southern Chinese origin. It grows as an adherent culture and lacks contact inhibition. In addition, it is tumorigenic in athymic nude mice. The cells consistently express EBV-encoded RNAs and are positively stained for cytokeratin, an epithelial marker. In addition, they express EBNA1 protein, LMP1 and LMP2 transcripts and thus resemble the EBV latency II pattern. The virus genotype is EBV-1 with the latent membrane protein 1 gene showing a 30-bp deletion at the carboxyl terminus, both consistent with findings in southern Chinese NPC tumours. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a sub-diploid status with a chromosomal modal number of 45. C666-1 is unique among NPC cell lines in that it carries EBV.

The physiological importance yet limited understanding of MT-A70 and its apparent lack of similarity to other known RNA MTases combined to make this protein an attractive target for bioinformatic analysis. The sequence of MT-A70 was subjected to extensive in silico analysis to identify orthologous and paralogous polypeptides. This analysis revealed that the MT-A70 family comprises four subfamilies with varying degrees of interrelatedness. One subfamily is a small group of bacterial DNA:m(6)A MTases. The other three subfamilies are paralogous eukaryotic lineages, two of which have not been associated with MTase activity but include proteins having substantial regulatory effects. Multiple sequence alignments and structure prediction for members of all four subfamilies indicated a high probability that a consensus MTase fold domain is present. Significantly, this consensus fold shows the permuted topology characteristic of the b class of MTases, which to date has only been known to include DNA MTases.},

abstract = {African annual fishes from the genus Nothobranchius are small teleosts that inhabit temporary water bodies subject to annual desiccation due to the alternation of the monsoon seasons. Given their unique biology, these fish have emerged as a model taxon in several biological disciplines. Their increasing popularity stems from the extremely short lifespan that is the result of their specific life-history adaptations and is retained under laboratory conditions. Nothobranchius furzeri, the most popular laboratory species, is the vertebrate species with the shortest lifespan recorded in captivity. In the laboratory, adults of different Nothobranchius species and populations live between 3 and 18 months and, notably, there is a negative correlation between the captive lifespan of a species and the aridity of their habitat. Their short lifespan is coupled to rapid age-dependent functional decline and expression of cellular and molecular changes comparable to those observed in other vertebrates, including humans. The recent development of transgenesis in this species makes it possible to insert specific constructs into their genome, and the establishment of transgenic lines is facilitated by their very rapid generation time, which can be as short as 1 month. This makes Nothobranchius species particularly suited for investigating biological and molecular aspects of ageing and ageing-associated dysfunctions. At the same time, they also represent a unique model taxon to investigate the evolution of life-history adaptations and their genetic architecture. We review their natural history, including phylogenetic relationships, distribution in relation to habitat conditions and natural selection for differential longevity, population structure and demography, and life cycle with emphasis on diapause that may occur at three stages during embryonic development. We further critically evaluate their use as a laboratory model for understanding the evolution of a rapid ageing rate and its consequences for other life-history traits, for cellular, molecular and integrative traits associated with the ageing process, high incidence of neoplasias, their utility for genome-wide gene-expression studies, and as a model for quantitative genetics. We summarize recent achievements in fostering Nothobranchius species as a widely applicable model system, including an annotated transcriptome, successful transgenesis, and existence of viable inbred lines. We compare the conditions they experience in the wild and in captivity and suggest that they are an ideal taxon to investigate natural genetic variation in a laboratory setting. We conclude that Nothobranchius species - and N. furzeri in particular - could become a unique model taxon that bridges interests in ecological and biomedical research. We hope that a conceptual and methodological integration of these two branches of biology will provide important new insights. Biological Reviews},

abstract = {Transposable element (TE)-derived sequences comprise half of the human genome and DNA methylome and are presumed to be densely methylated and inactive. Examination of genome-wide DNA methylation status within 928 TE subfamilies in human embryonic and adult tissues identified unexpected tissue-specific and subfamily-specific hypomethylation signatures. Genes proximal to tissue-specific hypomethylated TE sequences were enriched for functions important for the relevant tissue type, and their expression correlated strongly with hypomethylation within the TEs. When hypomethylated, these TE sequences gained tissue-specific enhancer marks, including monomethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1) and occupancy by p300, and a majority exhibited enhancer activity in reporter gene assays. Many such TEs also harbored binding sites for transcription factors that are important for tissue-specific functions and showed evidence of evolutionary selection. These data suggest that sequences derived from TEs may be responsible for wiring tissue type-specific regulatory networks and may have acquired tissue-specific epigenetic regulation.},

abstract = {Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a Gram-negative bacterium that is a pathogen of other Gram-negative bacteria, including many bacteria which are pathogens of humans, animals and plants. As such Bdellovibrio has potential as a biocontrol agent, or living antibiotic. B. bacteriovorus HD100 has a large genome and it is not yet known which of it encodes the molecular machinery and genetic control of predatory processes. We have tried to fill this knowledge-gap using mixtures of predator and prey mRNAs to monitor changes in Bdellovibrio gene expression at a timepoint of early-stage prey infection and prey killing in comparison to control cultures of predator and prey alone and also in comparison to Bdellovibrio growing axenically (in a prey-or host independent "HI" manner) on artificial media containing peptone and tryptone. From this we have highlighted genes of the early predatosome with predicted roles in prey killing and digestion and have gained insights into possible regulatory mechanisms as Bdellovibrio enter and establish within the prey bdelloplast. Approximately seven percent of all Bdellovibrio genes were significantly up-regulated at 30 minutes of infection--but not in HI growth--implicating the role of these genes in prey digestion. Five percent were down-regulated significantly, implicating their role in free-swimming, attack-phase physiology. This study gives the first post-genomic insight into the predatory process and reveals some of the important genes that Bdellovibrio expresses inside the prey bacterium during the initial attack.},

abstract = {Epigenome-wide association studies of disease widely use DNA methylation measured in blood as a surrogate tissue. Cell proportions can vary between people and confound associations of exposure or outcome. An adequate reference panel for estimating cell proportions from adult whole blood for DNA methylation studies is available, but an analogous cord blood cell reference panel is not yet available. Cord blood has unique cell types and the epigenetic signatures of standard cell types may not be consistent throughout the life course. Using magnetic bead sorting, we isolated cord blood cell types (nucleated red blood cells, granulocytes, monocytes, natural killer cells, B cells, CD4(+)T cells, and CD8(+)T cells) from 17 live births at Johns Hopkins Hospital. We confirmed enrichment of the cell types using fluorescence assisted cell sorting and ran DNA from the separated cell types on the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. After filtering, the final analysis was on 104 samples at 429,794 probes. We compared cell type specific signatures in cord to each other and methylation at 49.2{\%} of CpG sites on the array differed by cell type (F-test P {\textless} 10(-8)). Differences between nucleated red blood cells and the remainder of the cell types were most pronounced (36.9{\%} of CpG sites at P {\textless} 10(-8)) and 99.5{\%} of these sites were hypomethylated relative to the other cell types. We also compared the mean-centered sorted cord profiles to the available adult reference panel and observed high correlation between the overlapping cell types for granulocytes and monocytes (both r=0.74), and poor correlation for CD8(+)T cells and NK cells (both r=0.08). We further provide an algorithm for estimating cell proportions in cord blood using the newly developed cord reference panel, which estimates biologically plausible cell proportions in whole cord blood samples.},

Objective: We assessed which maternal and environmental characteristics were associated with 25(OH)D after supplementation with cholecalciferol. Design: Within-randomization-group analysis of participants in the Maternal Vitamin D Osteo-porosis Study trial of vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy. Setting: Hospital antenatal clinics. Participants: A total of 829 pregnant women (422 placebo, 407 cholecalciferol). At 14 and 34 weeks of gestation, maternal anthropometry, health, and lifestyle were assessed and 25(OH)D measured. Compliance was determined using pill counts at 19 and 34 weeks. Interventions: 1000 IU/d of cholecalciferol or matched placebo from 14 weeks of gestation until delivery. Main Outcome Measure: 25(OH)D at 34 weeks, measured in a single batch (Diasorin Liaison). Results: 25(OH)D at 34 weeks of gestation was higher in the women randomized to vitamin D (mean [SD], 67.7 [21.3] nmol/L) compared with placebo (43.1 [22.5] nmol/L; P Ͻ .001). In women randomized to cholecalciferol, higher pregnancy weight gain from 14 to 34 weeks of gestation (kg) (␤ ϭ Ϫ0.81 [95{\%} confidence interval Ϫ1.39, Ϫ0.22]), lower compliance with study medication ({\%}) (␤ ϭ Ϫ0.28 [Ϫ0.072, Ϫ0.48]), lower early pregnancy 25(OH)D (nmol/L) (␤ ϭ 0.28 [0.16, 0.40]), and delivery in the winter vs the summer (␤ ϭ Ϫ10.5 [Ϫ6.4, Ϫ14.6]) were independently associated with lower 25(OH)D at 34 weeks of gestation. Conclusions: Women who gained more weight during pregnancy had lower 25(OH)D in early preg-nancy and delivered in winter achieved a lower 25(OH)D in late pregnancy when supplemented with 1000 IU/d cholecalciferol. Future studies should aim to determine appropriate doses to enable consis-tent repletion of 25(OH)D during pregnancy. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 101: 0000 – 0000, 2016)},

Using identity-by-descent estimates, we show that at least 40{\%} of the total heritable cis effect on expression cannot be accounted for by common cis variants, a finding that reveals the contribution of low-frequency and rare regulatory variants with respect to both transcriptional regulation and complex trait susceptibility. We show that a substantial proportion of gene expression heritability is trans to the structural gene, and we identify several replicating trans variants that act predominantly in a tissue-restricted manner and may regulate the transcription of many genes.},

We found that the longevity of both age-1 and daf2 mutants requires the activities of the same two genes, duf16 and daf-18. In addition, the daf2(e1370); age-l(hx546) double mutant did not live significantly longer than the daf2 single mutant.

All four 2'-O-methylribonucleosides, but only two base-methylated derivatives, 7-methylguanosine (7MeG) and 6-methyladenosine (6MeA), were identified. 6MeA was the major component accounting for approximately 50{\%} of the total methyl-labeled ribonucleosides. 7MeG, comprising about 10{\%} of the total, was present exclusively at the 5' terminus of the poly(A)+ RNA and could be removed by periodate oxidation and beta elimination. Evidence for a 5' to 5' linkage of 7MeG to adjacent 2'-O-methylribonucleosides through at least two and probably three phosphates to give structures of the type 7MeG5'ppp5pNMep- and 7MeG5'ppp5'NMepNmep- was presented.

abstract = {The amino acid sequence of Dnmt2 is very similar to the catalytic domains of bacterial and eukaryotic DNA-(cytosine 5)-methyltransferases, but it efficiently catalyzes tRNA methylation, while its DNA methyltransferase activity is the subject of controversial reports with rates varying between zero and very weak. By using composite nucleic acid molecules as substrates, we surprisingly found that DNA fragments, when presented as covalent DNA-RNA hybrids in the structural context of a tRNA, can be more efficiently methylated than the corresponding natural tRNA substrate. Furthermore, by stepwise development of tRNAAsp, we showed that this natural Dnmt2 substrate could be engineered to employ RNAs that act like guide RNAs in vitro. The 5'-half of tRNAAsp was able to efficiently guide methylation toward a single stranded tRNA fragment as would result from tRNA cleavage by tRNA specific nucleases. In a more artificial setting, a composite system of guide RNAs could ultimately be engineered to enable the enzyme to perform cytidine methylation on single stranded DNA in vitro.},

abstract = {Present-day members of the Chlamydiaceae contain parasitic bacteria that have been co-evolving with their eukaryotic hosts over hundreds of millions of years. Likewise, a type III secretion system encoded within all genomes has been refined to complement the unique obligate intracellular niche colonized so successfully by Chlamydia spp. All this adaptation has occurred in the apparent absence of the horizontal gene transfer responsible for creating the wide range of diversity in other Gram-negative, type III-expressing bacteria. The result is a system that is, in many ways, uniquely chlamydial. A critical mass of information has been amassed that sheds significant light on how the chlamydial secretion system functions and contributes to an obligate intracellular lifestyle. Although the overall mechanism is certainly similar to homologous systems, an image has emerged where the chlamydial secretion system is essential for both survival and virulence. Numerous apparent differences, some subtle and some profound, differentiate chlamydial type III secretion from others. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of the current state of knowledge regarding the Chlamydia type III secretion mechanism. We focus on the aspects that are distinctly chlamydial and comment on how this important system influences chlamydial pathogenesis. Gaining a grasp on this fascinating system has been challenging in the absence of a tractable genetic system. However, the surface of this tough nut has been scored and the future promises to be fruitful and revealing.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND A key focus in cancer research is the discovery of biomarkers that accurately diagnose early lesions in non-invasive tissues. Several studies have identified malignancy-associated DNA methylation changes in blood, yet no general cancer biomarker has been identified to date. Here, we explore the potential of blood DNA methylation as a biomarker of pan-cancer (cancer of multiple different origins) in 41 female cancer discordant monozygotic (MZ) twin-pairs sampled before or after diagnosis using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. RESULTS We analysed epigenome-wide DNA methylation profiles in 41 cancer discordant MZ twin-pairs with affected individuals diagnosed with tumours at different single primary sites: the breast, cervix, colon, endometrium, thyroid gland, skin (melanoma), ovary, and pancreas. No significant global differences in whole blood DNA methylation profiles were observed. Epigenome-wide analyses identified one novel pan-cancer differentially methylated position at false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 10 {\%} (cg02444695, P = 1.8 × 10(-7)) in an intergenic region 70 kb upstream of the SASH1 tumour suppressor gene, and three suggestive signals in COL11A2, AXL, and LINC00340. Replication of the four top-ranked signals in an independent sample of nine cancer-discordant MZ twin-pairs showed a similar direction of association at COL11A2, AXL, and LINC00340, and significantly greater methylation discordance at AXL compared to 480 healthy concordant MZ twin-pairs. The effects at cg02444695 (near SASH1), COL11A2, and LINC00340 were the most promising in biomarker potential because the DNA methylation differences were found to pre-exist in samples obtained prior to diagnosis and were limited to a 5-year period before diagnosis. Gene expression follow-up at the top-ranked signals in 283 healthy individuals showed correlation between blood methylation and gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines at PRL, and in the skin tissue at AXL. A significant enrichment of differential DNA methylation was observed in enhancer regions (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS We identified DNA methylation signatures in blood associated with pan-cancer, at or near SASH1, COL11A2, AXL, and LINC00340. Three of these signals were present up to 5 years prior to cancer diagnosis, highlighting the potential clinical utility of whole blood DNA methylation analysis in cancer surveillance.},

abstract = {Transposable elements are viewed as 'selfish genetic elements', yet they contribute to gene regulation and genome evolution in diverse ways. More than half of the human genome consists of transposable elements. Alu elements belong to the short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) family of repetitive elements, and with over 1 million insertions they make up more than 10{\%} of the human genome. Despite their abundance and the potential evolutionary advantages they confer, Alu elements can be mutagenic to the host as they can act as splice acceptors, inhibit translation of mRNAs and cause genomic instability. Alu elements are the main targets of the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR and the formation of Alu exons is suppressed by the nuclear ribonucleoprotein HNRNPC, but the broad effect of massive secondary structures formed by inverted-repeat Alu elements on RNA processing in the nucleus remains unknown. Here we show that DHX9, an abundant nuclear RNA helicase, binds specifically to inverted-repeat Alu elements that are transcribed as parts of genes. Loss of DHX9 leads to an increase in the number of circular-RNA-producing genes and amount of circular RNAs, translational repression of reporters containing inverted-repeat Alu elements, and transcriptional rewiring (the creation of mostly nonsensical novel connections between exons) of susceptible loci. Biochemical purifications of DHX9 identify the interferon-inducible isoform of ADAR (p150), but not the constitutively expressed ADAR isoform (p110), as an RNA-independent interaction partner. Co-depletion of ADAR and DHX9 augments the double-stranded RNA accumulation defects, leading to increased circular RNA production, revealing a functional link between these two enzymes. Our work uncovers an evolutionarily conserved function of DHX9. We propose that it acts as a nuclear RNA resolvase that neutralizes the immediate threat posed by transposon insertions and allows these elements to evolve as tools for the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.},

abstract = {Attempts to enrich or identify DNA with cytosine methylation have been commonly carried out using anti-5-methylcytosine or anti-MBD2 (methyl-CpG binding domain protein 2) antibody in immunoprecipitation (IP) assays. However, a careful and systematic control experiment to examine the sensitivity and specificity of this approach has not been reported. It is of critical importance to understand the potential pitfalls of this approach and to avoid potential misinterpretation of findings. We found that increased concentration of antibody used in the assay increased the amount of overall DNA captured as expected. The increased number of methylated cytosines in/on the DNA fragment also increased the amount of DNA captured by the antibody. Importantly, the antibody can bind to some fully unmethylated DNA fragments, even when fully methylated DNA is present in the same experiment. The sensitivity of anti-5-methylcytosine antibody and anti-MBD2 antibody/MBD2 binding varies with the number of methylated cytosines on the DNA target. The specificity of these antibodies can also vary for different DNA target sequences. DNA fragments with fewer CpG sites may not bind to these antibodies even when all are methylated while DNA fragments with more CpG sites may bind to the antibodies when only some of these sites are methylated. More importantly, binding of DNA to these antibodies does not always indicate the presence of DNA methylation. It is clear that false positive and false negative findings can be easily reached even though it does not nullify these convenient and simple methods completely. Great caution should be taken for the interpretation of IP results using these antibodies and rigorous confirmation by sodium bisulfite sequencing is essential.},

abstract = {Motivation Translation is a key biological process controlled in eukaryotes by the initiation AUG codon. Variations affecting this codon may have pathological consequences by disturbing the correct initiation of translation. Unfortunately, there is no systematic study describing these variations in the human genome. Moreover, we aimed to develop new tools for in silico prediction of the pathogenicity of gene variations affecting AUG codons, because to date, these gene defects have been wrongly classified as missense. Results Whole-exome analysis revealed the mean of 12 gene variations per person affecting initiation codons, mostly with high ({\textgreater}0.01) minor allele frequency (MAF). Moreover, analysis of Ensembl data (December 2017) revealed 11 261 genetic variations affecting the initiation AUG codon of 7205 genes. Most of these variations (99.5{\%}) have low or unknown MAF, probably reflecting deleterious consequences. Only 62 variations had high MAF. Genetic variations with high MAF had closer alternative AUG downstream codons than did those with low MAF. Besides, the high-MAF group better maintained both the signal peptide and reading frame. These differentiating elements could help to determine the pathogenicity of this kind of variation.

abstract = {Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the commonest form of muscular dystrophy, is caused by lack of dystrophin. One of the most promising therapeutic approaches is antisense-mediated elimination of frame-disrupting mutations by exon skipping. However, this approach faces two major hurdles: limited applicability of each individual target exon and uncertain function and stability of each resulting truncated dystrophin. Skipping of exons 45-55 at the mutation hotspot of the DMD gene would address both issues. Theoretically it could rescue more than 60{\%} of patients with deletion mutations. Moreover, spontaneous deletions of this specific region are associated with asymptomatic or exceptionally mild phenotypes. However, such multiple exon skipping of exons 45-55 has proved technically challenging. We have therefore designed antisense oligo (AO) morpholino mixtures to minimize self- or heteroduplex formation. These were tested as conjugates with cell-penetrating moieties (vivo-morpholinos). We have tested the feasibility of skipping exons 45-55 in H2K-mdx52 myotubes and in mdx52 mice, which lack exon 52. Encouragingly, with mixtures of 10 AOs, we demonstrated skipping of all 10 exons in vitro, in H2K-mdx52 myotubes and on intramuscular injection into mdx52 mice. Moreover, in mdx52 mice in vivo, systemic injections of 10 AOs induced extensive dystrophin expression at the subsarcolemma in skeletal muscles throughout the body, producing up to 15{\%} of wild-type dystrophin protein levels, accompanied by improved muscle strength and histopathology without any detectable toxicity. This is a unique successful demonstration of effective rescue by exon 45-55 skipping in a dystrophin-deficient animal model.},

Loss of NO bioavailability due to reduced synthesis and increased scavenging by reactive oxygen species is a cardinal feature of endothelial dysfunction in vascular disease states. The pteridine cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) has emerged as a critical determinant of eNOS activity: when BH4 availability is limiting, eNOS no longer produces NO but instead generates superoxide. In vascular disease states, there is oxidative degradation of BH4 by reactive oxygen species. However, augmentation of BH4 concentrations in vascular disease by pharmacological supplementation, by enhancement of its rate of de novo biosynthesis or by measures to reduce its oxidation, has been shown in experimental studies to enhance NO bioavailability. Thus, BH4 represents a potential therapeutic target in the regulation of eNOS function in vascular disease.},

abstract = {DNA methylation is a defining feature of mammalian cellular identity and is essential for normal development. Most cell types, except germ cells and pre-implantation embryos, display relatively stable DNA methylation patterns, with 70-80{\%} of all CpGs being methylated. Despite recent advances, we still have a limited understanding of when, where and how many CpGs participate in genomic regulation. Here we report the in-depth analysis of 42 whole-genome bisulphite sequencing data sets across 30 diverse human cell and tissue types. We observe dynamic regulation for only 21.8{\%} of autosomal CpGs within a normal developmental context, most of which are distal to transcription start sites. These dynamic CpGs co-localize with gene regulatory elements, particularly enhancers and transcription-factor-binding sites, which allow identification of key lineage-specific regulators. In addition, differentially methylated regions (DMRs) often contain single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with cell-type-related diseases as determined by genome-wide association studies. The results also highlight the general inefficiency of whole-genome bisulphite sequencing, as 70-80{\%} of the sequencing reads across these data sets provided little or no relevant information about CpG methylation. To demonstrate further the utility of our DMR set, we use it to classify unknown samples and identify representative signature regions that recapitulate major DNA methylation dynamics. In summary, although in theory every CpG can change its methylation state, our results suggest that only a fraction does so as part of coordinated regulatory programs. Therefore, our selected DMRs can serve as a starting point to guide new, more effective reduced representation approaches to capture the most informative fraction of CpGs, as well as further pinpoint putative regulatory elements.},

Here, we use recently devised sgRNA design rules to create human and mouse genome-wide libraries, perform positive and negative selection screens and observe that the use of these rules produced improved results. Additionally, we profile the off-target activity of thousands of sgRNAs and develop a metric to predict off-target sites.

abstract = {Many bacteria mediate important life-style decisions by varying levels of the second messenger c-di-GMP. Behavioral transitions result from the coordination of complex cellular processes such as motility, surface adherence or the production of virulence factors and toxins. While the regulatory mechanisms responsible for these processes have been elucidated in some cases, the global pleiotropic effects of c-di-GMP are poorly understood, primarily because c-di-GMP networks are inherently complex in most bacteria. Moreover, the quantitative relationships between cellular c-di-GMP levels and c-di-GMP dependent phenotypes are largely unknown. Here, we dissect the c-di-GMP network of Caulobacter crescentus to establish a global and quantitative view of c-di-GMP dependent processes in this organism. A genetic approach that gradually reduced the number of diguanylate cyclases identified novel c-di-GMP dependent cellular processes and unraveled c-di-GMP as an essential component of C. crescentus cell polarity and its bimodal life cycle. By varying cellular c-di-GMP concentrations, we determined dose response curves for individual c-di-GMP-dependent processes. Relating these values to c-di-GMP levels modeled for single cells progressing through the cell cycle sets a quantitative frame for the successive activation of c-di-GMP dependent processes during the C. crescentus life cycle. By reconstructing a simplified c-di-GMP network in a strain devoid of c-di-GMP we defined the minimal requirements for the oscillation of c-di-GMP levels during the C. crescentus cell cycle. Finally, we show that although all c-di-GMP dependent cellular processes were qualitatively restored by artificially adjusting c-di-GMP levels with a heterologous diguanylate cyclase, much higher levels of the second messenger are required under these conditions as compared to the contribution of homologous c-di-GMP metabolizing enzymes. These experiments suggest that a common c-di-GMP pool cannot fully explain spatiotemporal regulation by c-di-GMP in C. crescentus and that individual enzymes preferentially regulate specific phenotypes during the cell cycle.},

These interactions may facilitate both TFIIIB and RNA polymerase III recruitment to the preinitiation complex by TFIIIC.

abstract = {Agonist-dependent desensitization and internalization of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) are mediated by the binding of arrestins to phosphorylated receptors. The affinity of arrestins for the phosphorylated GPCR regulates the ability of the internalized receptor to be dephosphorylated and recycled back to the plasma membrane. In this study, we show that the naturally occurring loss of function vasopressin receptor mutation R137H, which is associated with familial nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, induces constitutive arrestin-mediated desensitization. In contrast to the wild-type vasopressin receptor, the nonsignaling R137H receptor is phosphorylated and sequestered in arrestin-associated intracellular vesicles even in the absence of agonist. Eliminating molecular determinants on the receptor that promote high affinity arrestin-receptor interaction reestablishes plasma membrane localization and the ability of the mutated receptors to signal. These findings suggest that unregulated desensitization can contribute to the etiology of a GPCR-based disease, implying that pharmacological targeting of GPCR desensitization may be therapeutically beneficial.},

Genome-wide chromosome conformation capture studies have uncovered features of chromatin organization in cultured cells, but genome architecture in human tissues has yet to be explored. Here, we report the most comprehensive survey to date of chromatin organization in human tissues. Through integrative analysis of chromatin contact maps in 21 primary human tissues and cell types, we find topologically associating domains highly conserved in different tissues. We also discover genomic regions that exhibit unusually high levels of local chromatin interactions. These frequently interacting regions (FIREs) are enriched for super-enhancers and are near tissue-specifically expressed genes. They display strong tissue-specificity in local chromatin interactions. Additionally, FIRE formation is partially dependent on CTCF and the Cohesin complex. We further show that FIREs can help annotate the function of non-coding sequence variants.},

Deep whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of 49 methylomes revealed sequence-dependent CpG methylation imbalances at thousands of heterozygous regulatory loci. Such loci are enriched for stochastic switching, which is defined as random transitions between fully methylated and unmethylated states of DNA. The methylation imbalances at thousands of loci are explainable by different relative frequencies of the methylated and unmethylated states for the two alleles. Further analyses provided a unifying model that links sequence-dependent allelic imbalances of the epigenome, stochastic switching at gene regulatory loci, and disease-associated genetic variation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Gene body methylation at CG dinucleotides is a widely conserved feature of methylated genomes but remains poorly understood. The Arabidopsis thaliana strain Cvi has depleted gene body methylation relative to the reference strain Col. Here, we leverage this natural epigenetic difference to investigate gene body methylation stability. RESULTS Recombinant inbred lines derived from Col and Cvi were used to examine the transmission of distinct gene body methylation states. The vast majority of genic CG methylation patterns are faithfully transmitted over nine generations according to parental genotype, with only 1-4{\%} of CGs either losing or gaining methylation relative to the parent. Genic CGs that fail to maintain the parental methylation state are shared among independent lines, suggesting that these are not random occurrences. We use a logistic regression framework to identify features that best predict sites that fail to maintain parental methylation state. Intermediate levels of CG methylation around a dynamic CG site and high methylation variability across many A. thaliana strains at that site are the strongest predictors. These data suggest that the dynamic CGs we identify are not specific to the Col-Cvi recombinant inbred lines but have an epigenetic state that is inherently less stable within the A. thaliana species. Extending this, variably methylated genic CGs in maize and Brachypodium distachyon are also associated with intermediate local CG methylation. CONCLUSIONS These results provide new insights into the features determining the inheritance of gene body methylation and demonstrate that two different methylation equilibria can be maintained within single individuals.},

abstract = {We previously reported that Chlamydia trachomatis hypothetical protein CT311 was secreted out of chlamydial inclusion and into host cell cytosol. We now found that CT311 further entered host cell nucleus at the late stage of infection and continued to accumulate in the nucleus of C. trachomatis-infected cells. When CT311 was expressed via a transgene in mammalian cells, CT311 protein was exclusively detected in the nucleus, suggesting that CT311 by itself is sufficient for nuclear targeting. However, preexisting nuclear CT311 did not affect subsequent chlamydial infection. Using deletion constructs, we mapped a nuclear localization signal sequence of CT311 to residues 21 to 63 ((21)AVEGKPLSRAAQLRERRKDLHVSGKPSPRYALKKRALEAKKNK(63)). This sequence was sufficient for targeting a heterologous protein into mammalian cell nucleus and it contains two independent clusters of basic residues ((34)RERRK(38) and (53)KKRALEAKKNK(63) respectively). Deletion or alanine substitution of the basic residues in either cluster led to loss of nuclear targeting activity, suggesting that both clusters are critical for the nuclear targeting function. These observations have demonstrated that the hypothetical protein CT311 possesses a novel nuclear localization signal sequence with dual modules of basic residues for targeting host cell nucleus during Chlamydia trachomatis infection.},

abstract = {Protein ligand docking has recently been investigated as a tool for protein function identification, with some success in identifying both known and unknown substrates of proteins. However, identifying a protein's substrate when cross-docking a large number of enzymes and their cognate ligands remains a challenge. To explore a more limited yet practically important and timely problem in more detail, we have used docking for identifying the substrates of a single protein family with remarkable substrate diversity, the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases. We examine different protocols for identifying candidate substrates for 27 short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase proteins of known catalytic function. We present the results of docking {\textgreater}900 metabolites from the human metabolome to each of these proteins together with their known cognate substrates and products, and we investigate the ability of docking to (a) reproduce a viable binding mode for the substrate and (b) to rank the substrate highly amongst the dataset of other metabolites. In addition, we examine whether our docking results provide information about the nature of the substrate, based on the best-scoring metabolites in the dataset. We compare two different docking methods and two alternative scoring functions for one of the docking methods, and we attempt to rationalise both successes and failures. Finally, we introduce a new protocol, whereby we dock only a set of representative structures (medoids) to each of the proteins, in the hope of characterising each binding site in terms of its ligand preferences, with a reduced computational cost. We compare the results from this protocol with our original docking experiments, and we find that although the rank of the representatives correlates well with the mean rank of the clusters to which they belong, a simple structure-based clustering is too naive for the purpose of substrate identification. Many clusters comprise ligands with widely varying affinities for the same protein; hence important candidates can be missed if a single representative is used.},

abstract = {Cancer is an aging-associated disease, but the underlying molecular links between these processes are still largely unknown. Gene promoters that become hypermethylated in aging and cancer share a common chromatin signature in ES cells. In addition, there is also global DNA hypomethylation in both processes. However, the similarity of the regions where this loss of DNA methylation occurs is currently not well characterized, and it is unknown if such regions also share a common chromatin signature in aging and cancer. To address this issue, we analyzed TCGA DNA methylation data from a total of 2,311 samples, including control and cancer cases from patients with breast, kidney, thyroid, skin, brain, and lung tumors and healthy blood, and integrated the results with histone, chromatin state, and transcription factor binding site data from the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE projects. We identified 98,857 CpG sites differentially methylated in aging and 286,746 in cancer. Hyper- and hypomethylated changes in both processes each had a similar genomic distribution across tissues and displayed tissue-independent alterations. The identified hypermethylated regions in aging and cancer shared a similar bivalent chromatin signature. In contrast, hypomethylated DNA sequences occurred in very different chromatin contexts. DNA hypomethylated sequences were enriched at genomic regions marked with the activating histone posttranslational modification H3K4me1 in aging, while in cancer, loss of DNA methylation was primarily associated with the repressive H3K9me3 mark. Our results suggest that the role of DNA methylation as a molecular link between aging and cancer is more complex than previously thought.},

GREAT incorporates annotations from 20 ontologies and is available as a web application. Applying GREAT to data sets from chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) of multiple transcription-associated factors, including SRF, NRSF, GABP, Stat3 and p300 in different developmental contexts, we recover many functions of these factors that are missed by existing gene-based tools, and we generate testable hypotheses.

TRNA (tRNA) also exhibits large sequence diversity in the human genome, but tRNA gene sequence variation and potential functional implications in individual human genomes have not been investigated. Here we capitalize on the sequencing data from the 1000-genomes project to examine the diversity of tRNA genes in the human population. Previous analysis of the reference human genome indicated an unexpected large number of diverse tRNA genes beyond the necessity of translation, suggesting that some tRNA transcripts may perform non-canonical functions. We found 24 new tRNA sequences in{\textgreater}1{\%} and 76 new tRNA sequences in{\textgreater}0.2{\%} of all individuals, indicating that tRNA genes are also subject to evolutionary changes in the human population. Unexpectedly, two abundant new tRNA genes contain base-pair mismatches in the anticodon stem. We experimentally determined that these two new tRNAs have altered structures in vitro; however, one new tRNA is not aminoacylated but extremely stable in HeLa cells, suggesting that this new tRNA can be used for non-canonical function. Our results show that at the scale of human population, tRNA genes are more diverse than conventionally understood, and some new tRNAs may perform non-canonical, extra-translational functions that may be linked to human health and disease.},

abstract = {Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are key components of the translation machinery. They read codons on messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and deliver the appropriate amino acid to the ribosome for protein synthesis. The human genome encodes more than 500 tRNA genes but their individual contribution to the cellular tRNA pool is unclear. In recent years, novel methods were developed to improve the quantification of tRNA gene expression, most of which rely on next-generation sequencing such as small RNA-Seq applied to tRNAs (tRNA-Seq). In a previous study, we presented a bioinformatics strategy to analyse tRNA-Seq datasets that we named ‘isodecoder-specific tRNA gene contribution profiling' (Iso-tRNA-CP). Using Iso-tRNA-CP, we showed that tRNA gene expression is cell type- and tissue-specific and that this process can regulate tRNA-derived fragments abundance. An additional observation that stems from that work is that approximately half of human tRNA genes appeared silent or poorly expressed. In this commentary, I discuss this finding in light of the current literature and speculate on potential functions that transcriptionally silent tRNA genes may play. Studying silent tRNA genes may offer a unique opportunity to unravel novel mechanisms of cell regulation associated to tRNA biology.},

abstract = {Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) function in translational machinery and further serves as a source of short non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). tRNA-derived ncR- NAs show differential expression profiles and play roles in many biological processes beyond transla- tion. Molecular mechanisms that shape and regu- late their expression profiles are largely unknown. Here, we report the mechanism of biogenesis for tRNA-derived Piwi-interacting RNAs (td-piRNAs) ex- pressed in Bomb yx BmN4 cells. In the cells, two cy- toplasmic tRNA species, tRNAAspGUC and tRNAHisGUG, served as major sources for td-piRNAs, which were derived from the 5?-part of the respective tRNAs. cP-RNA-seq identified the two tRNAs as major sub- strates for the 5?-tRNA halves as well, suggesting a previously uncharacterized link between 5?-tRNA halves and td-piRNAs. An increase in levels of the 5?- tRNA halves, induced by BmNSun2 knockdown, en- hanced the td-piRNA expression levelswithout quan- titative change in mature tRNAs, indicating that 5?- tRNA halves, not mature tRNAs, are the direct precur- sors for td-piRNAs. For the generation of tRNAHisGUG- derived piRNAs, BmThg1l-mediated nucleotide addi- tion to −1 position of tRNAHisGUG was required, re- vealing an important function of BmThg1l in piRNA biogenesis. Our study advances the understanding of biogenesis mechanisms and the genesis of spe- cific expression profiles for tRNA-derived ncRNAs. INTRODUCTION},

abstract = {Aging (senescence) is characterized by the development of numerous pathologies, some of which limit lifespan. Key to understanding aging is discovery of the mechanisms (etiologies) that cause senescent pathology. In C. elegans, a major senescent pathology of unknown etiology is atrophy of its principal metabolic organ, the intestine. Here we identify a cause of not only this pathology but also of yolky lipid accumulation and redistribution (a form of senescent obesity): autophagy-mediated conversion of intestinal biomass into yolk. Inhibiting intestinal autophagy or vitellogenesis rescues both visceral pathologies and can also extend lifespan. This defines a disease syndrome leading to multimorbidity and contributing to late-life mortality. Activation of gut-to-yolk biomass conversion by insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) promotes reproduction and senescence. This illustrates how major, IIS-promoted senescent pathologies in C. elegans can originate not from damage accumulation but from direct effects of futile, continued action of a wild-type biological program (vitellogenesis). Ezcurra, Benedetto et al. identify a mechanism causing aging in C. elegans: autophagy-dependent gut-to-yolk biomass conversion. This is activated by life-shortening insulin/IGF-1 signaling and causes diseases of aging, including intestinal atrophy and yolk steatosis. The mechanism involved fits the recently proposed hyper-function theory of aging.},

abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a large class of RNAs that, unlike linear RNAs, form covalently closed continuous loops and have recently shown huge capabilities as gene regulators in mammals. These circRNAs mainly arise from exons or introns, and are differentially generated by back splicing or lariat introns. Interestingly, they are found to be enormously abundant, evolutionally conserved and relatively stable in cytoplasm. These features confer numerous potential functions to circRNAs, such as acting as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, binding to RNA-associated proteins to form RNA-protein complexes and then regulating gene transcription. Importantly, circRNAs associate with cancer-related miRNAs and the circRNA-miRNA axes are involved in cancer-related pathways. Some synthetic circRNAs have shown the remarkable anti-cancer effects. Though circRNAs are ancient molecules, the huge therapeutic potentials of circRNAs are recently being discovered from the laboratory to the clinic. Here, we review the current understanding of the roles of circRNAs in cancers and the potential implications of circRNAs in cancer targeted therapy.},

abstract = {Chromatin profiling has emerged as a powerful means for genome annotation and detection of regulatory activity. Here we map nine chromatin marks across nine cell types to systematically characterize regulatory elements, their cell type-specificities, and their functional interactions. Focusing on cell type-specific patterns of promoters and enhancers, we define multi-cell activity profiles for chromatin state, gene expression, regulatory motif enrichment, and regulator expression. We use correlations between these profiles to link enhancers to putative target genes, and predict the cell type-specific activators and repressors that modulate them. The resulting annotations and regulatory predictions have implications for interpreting genome-wide association studies. Top-scoring disease SNPs are frequently positioned within enhancer elements specifically active in relevant cell types, and in some cases affect a motif instance for a predicted regulator, thus proposing a mechanism for the association.

abstract = {Circular RNAs composed of exonic sequence have been described in a small number of genes. Thought to result from splicing errors, circular RNA species possess no known function. To delineate the universe of endogenous circular RNAs, we performed high-throughput sequencing (RNA-seq) of libraries prepared from ribosome-depleted RNA with or without digestion with the RNA exonuclease, RNase R. We identified {\textgreater}25,000 distinct RNA species in human fibroblasts that contained non-colinear exons (a "backsplice") and were reproducibly enriched by exonuclease degradation of linear RNA. These RNAs were validated as circular RNA (ecircRNA), rather than linear RNA, and were more stable than associated linear mRNAs in vivo. In some cases, the abundance of circular molecules exceeded that of associated linear mRNA by {\textgreater}10-fold. By conservative estimate, we identified ecircRNAs from 14.4{\%} of actively transcribed genes in human fibroblasts. Application of this method to murine testis RNA identified 69 ecircRNAs in precisely orthologous locations to human circular RNAs. Of note, paralogous kinases HIPK2 and HIPK3 produce abundant ecircRNA from their second exon in both humans and mice. Though HIPK3 circular RNAs contain an AUG translation start, it and other ecircRNAs were not bound to ribosomes. Circular RNAs could be degraded by siRNAs and, therefore, may act as competing endogenous RNAs. Bioinformatic analysis revealed shared features of circularized exons, including long bordering introns that contained complementary ALU repeats. These data show that ecircRNAs are abundant, stable, conserved and nonrandom products of RNA splicing that could be involved in control of gene expression.},

Biochemical studies suggest that this process may be mediated by methyl-specific binding proteins that recruit enzymatic machinery capable of locally altering histone modification. To test whether DNA methylation actually has a role in the assembly of chromatin during normal development, we used cell transfection and a transgene construct genetically programmed to be either methylated or unmethylated in all cell types of the mouse. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis shows that the presence of DNA methylation brings about the deacetylation of histone H4 and methylation of Lys9 of histone H3 (H3 Lys9) and prevents methylation of Lys4 of histone H3 (H3 Lys4), thus generating a structure identical to that of methylated sequences in the genome. These results indicate that the methylation pattern established in early embryogenesis is profoundly important in setting up the structural profile of the genome.},

As yet little is known about the contribution of various DNA repair pathways to prevent mutagenesis.

Overall, 44{\%} of lines show {\textgreater}2-fold increased mutagenesis with a broad spectrum of mutational outcomes including changes in single or multiple types of base substitutions induced by defects in base excision or nucleotide excision repair, or elevated levels of 50-400 bp deletions in translesion polymerase mutants rev-3 (pol $\zeta$) and polh-1 (pol $\eta$). Mutational signatures associated with defective homologous recombination fall into two classes: 1) mutants lacking brc-1/BRCA1 or rad-51 /RAD51 paralogs show elevated base substitutions, indels and structural variants, while 2) deficiency for MUS-81/MUS81 and SLX-1/SLX1 nucleases, and HIM-6/BLM, HELQ-1/HELQ and RTEL-1/RTEL1 helicases primarily cause structural variants. Genome-wide investigation of mutagenesis patterns identified elevated rates of tandem duplications often associated with inverted repeats in helq-1 mutants, and a unique pattern of ‘translocation' events involving homeologous sequences in rip-1 paralog mutants. atm-1/ ATM DNA damage checkpoint mutants harboured complex structural variants enriched in subtelomeric regions, and chromosome end-to-end fusions. Finally, while inactivation of the p53 -like gene cep-1 did not affect mutagenesis, combined brc-1 cep-1 deficiency displayed increased, locally clustered mutagenesis. In summary, we provide a global view of how DNA repair pathways prevent germ cell mutagenesis.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The human genome encodes hundreds of transfer RNA (tRNA) genes but their individual contribution to the tRNA pool is not fully understood. Deep sequencing of tRNA transcripts (tRNA-Seq) can estimate tRNA abundance at single gene resolution, but tRNA structures and posttranscriptional modifications impair these analyses. Here we present a bioinformatics strategy to investigate differential tRNA gene expression and use it to compare tRNA-Seq datasets from cultured human cells and human brain. We find that sequencing caveats affect quantitation of only a subset of human tRNA genes. Unexpectedly, we detect several cases where the differences in tRNA expression among samples do not involve variations at the level of isoacceptor tRNA sets (tRNAs charged with the same amino acid but using different anticodons), but rather among tRNA genes within the same isodecoder set (tRNAs having the same anticodon sequence). Because isodecoder tRNAs are functionally equal in terms of genetic translation, their differential expression may be related to noncanonical tRNA functions. We show that several instances of differential tRNA gene expression result in changes in the abundance of tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) but not of mature tRNAs. Examples of differentially expressed tRFs include PIWI-associated RNAs, tRFs present in tissue samples but not in cells cultured in vitro, and somatic tissue-specific tRFs. Our data support that differential expression of tRNA genes regulate noncanonical tRNA functions performed by tRFs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Alu retrotransposons are the most numerous and active mobile elements in humans, causing genetic disease and creating genomic diversity. Mobile element scanning (ME-Scan) enables comprehensive and affordable identification of mobile element insertions (MEI) using targeted high-throughput sequencing of multiplexed MEI junction libraries. In a single experiment, ME-Scan identifies nearly all AluYb8 and AluYb9 elements, with high sensitivity for both rare and common insertions, in 169 individuals of diverse ancestry. ME-Scan detects heterozygous insertions in single individuals with 91{\%} sensitivity. Insertion presence or absence states determined by ME-Scan are 95{\%} concordant with those determined by locus-specific PCR assays. By sampling diverse populations from Africa, South Asia, and Europe, we are able to identify 5799 Alu insertions, including 2524 novel ones, some of which occur in exons. Sub-Saharan populations and a Pygmy group in particular carry numerous intermediate-frequency Alu insertions that are absent in non-African groups. There is a significant dearth of exon-interrupting insertions among common Alu polymorphisms, but the density of singleton Alu insertions is constant across exonic and nonexonic regions. In one case, a validated novel singleton Alu interrupts a proteincoding exon of FAM187B. This implies that exonic Alu insertions are generally deleterious and thus eliminated by natural selection, but not so quickly that they cannot be observed as extremely rare variants. {\textcopyright} 2013, Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

METHODS: DNA from two cell lines were profiled by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, methyl capture sequencing (SS-Meth Seq), NimbleGen SeqCapEpi CpGiant(Nimblegen MethSeq), methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) and the Human Methylation 450 Bead Chip (Meth450K). RESULTS {\&} CONCLUSION: Despite differences in genome-wide coverage, high correlation and concordance were observed between different methods. Significant overlap of differentially methylated regions was identified between sequenced based platforms. MeDIP provided the best coverage for the whole genome and gene body regions, while RRBS and Nimblegen MethSeq were superior for CpGs in CpG islands and promoters. Methylation analyses can be achieved by any of the five methods but understanding their differences may better address the research question being posed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND DNA methylation is a stable form of epigenetic memory used by cells to control gene expression. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) has emerged as a gold-standard experimental technique for studying DNA methylation by producing high resolution genome-wide methylation profiles. Statistical modeling and analysis is employed to computationally extract and quantify information from these profiles in an effort to identify regions of the genome that demonstrate crucial or aberrant epigenetic behavior. However, the performance of most currently available methods for methylation analysis is hampered by their inability to directly account for statistical dependencies between neighboring methylation sites, thus ignoring significant information available in WGBS reads. RESULTS We present a powerful information-theoretic approach for genome-wide modeling and analysis of WGBS data based on the 1D Ising model of statistical physics. This approach takes into account correlations in methylation by utilizing a joint probability model that encapsulates all information available in WGBS methylation reads and produces accurate results even when applied on single WGBS samples with low coverage. Using the Shannon entropy, our approach provides a rigorous quantification of methylation stochasticity in individual WGBS samples genome-wide. Furthermore, it utilizes the Jensen-Shannon distance to evaluate differences in methylation distributions between a test and a reference sample. Differential performance assessment using simulated and real human lung normal/cancer data demonstrate a clear superiority of our approach over DSS, a recently proposed method for WGBS data analysis. Critically, these results demonstrate that marginal methods become statistically invalid when correlations are present in the data. CONCLUSIONS This contribution demonstrates clear benefits and the necessity of modeling joint probability distributions of methylation using the 1D Ising model of statistical physics and of quantifying methylation stochasticity using concepts from information theory. By employing this methodology, substantial improvement of DNA methylation analysis can be achieved by effectively taking into account the massive amount of statistical information available in WGBS data, which is largely ignored by existing methods.},

Recently, researchers' attention has turn toward epigenetic markers of aging. Using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip on whole blood DNA from a small cohort of 64 subjects of different ages, we identified 3 regions, the CpG islands of ELOVL2, FHL2, and PENK genes, whose methylation level strongly correlates with age. These results were confirmed by the Sequenom's EpiTYPER assay on a larger cohort of 501 subjects from 9 to 99 years, including 7 cord blood samples. Among the 3 genes, ELOVL2 shows a progressive increase in methylation that begins since the very first stage of life (Spearman's correlation coefficient = 0.92) and appears to be a very promising biomarker of aging.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in sequencing-based DNA methylation profiling methods provide an unprecedented opportunity to map complete DNA methylomes. These include whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS, MethylC-seq, or BS-seq), reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), and enrichment-based methods such as MeDIP-seq, MBD-seq, and MRE-seq. These methods yield largely comparable results but differ significantly in extent of genomic CpG coverage, resolution, quantitative accuracy, and cost, at least while using current algorithms to interrogate the data. None of these existing methods provides single-CpG resolution, comprehensive genome-wide coverage, and cost feasibility for a typical laboratory. We introduce methylCRF, a novel conditional random fields-based algorithm that integrates methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP-seq) and methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme (MRE-seq) sequencing data to predict DNA methylation levels at single-CpG resolution. Our method is a combined computational and experimental strategy to produce DNA methylomes of all 28 million CpGs in the human genome for a fraction ({\textless}10{\%}) of the cost of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing methods. methylCRF was benchmarked for accuracy against Infinium arrays, RRBS, WGBS sequencing, and locus-specific bisulfite sequencing performed on the same human embryonic stem cell line. methylCRF transformation of MeDIP-seq/MRE-seq was equivalent to a biological replicate of WGBS in quantification, coverage, and resolution. We used conventional bisulfite conversion, PCR, cloning, and sequencing to validate loci where our predictions do not agree with whole-genome bisulfite data, and in 11 out of 12 cases, methylCRF predictions of methylation level agree better with validated results than does whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. Therefore, methylCRF transformation of MeDIP-seq/MRE-seq data provides an accurate, inexpensive, and widely accessible strategy to create full DNA methylomes.},

@article{Richardson2003,
abstract = {The biochemistry of aging is complex, with biologically significant changes occurring in proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. One of these changes is in the methylation of DNA. DNA methylation is a mechanism modifying gene expression. The methylation of sequences in or near regulatory elements can suppress gene expression through effects on DNA binding proteins and chromatin structure. Both increases and decreases in methylation occur with aging, depending on the tissue and the gene. These changes can have pathologic consequences, contributing to the development of malignancies and autoimmunity with aging, and possibly to other disorders as well. Thus, while aging can impact on DNA methylation, the changes in DNA methylation can also impact on aging. This review summarizes current evidence for changes in the methylation status of specific genes with aging, their impact on diseases that develop with aging, and mechanisms that may contribute to the altered DNA methylation patterns. As this field is still developing, it is anticipated that new knowledge will continue to accumulate rapidly. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},
