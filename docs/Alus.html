<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Abstract</h2>
<p>Alu repeat elements the most numerous repetitive sequence element in the human genome making up ~10.7% of total genomic sequence.
Alus are generally repressed but contain features with the potential to have regulatory impact were they accessible.
Loss of the repression of repetitive elements is thought to occur with age, due in part to a reduction in global DNA methylation levels driven by repeats.
This change in DNA methylation in repetitive elements with age may capture information about biological ageing not captured by other such DNA methylation based predictors.
Age predictors trained using elastic net regression on MeDIP-seq data for Alus (n = 774)
were able to predict the age of an unrelated set of (n = 664) individuals with and R of 0.65 and a median absolute error of 8.1 years.
The Alu age estimators were prone to overestimating the age of older samples and underestimating the age of younger samples.
The difference between predicted age and chronological age, the Alu age acceleration was used to perform GWAS.
The top 4 SNPs common between GWAS for 2 different Alu age predictors showed associations with phenotypes plausibly related to biological ageing.
However, Alu Age acceleration was observed to be strongly correlated with Chronological age rendering it difficult to separate genetic associations with Alu age acceleration from those with chronological age.
This association may be due to the relatively poor quantitation of absolute methylation levels by MeDIP-seq resulting in bias in the age prediction model.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>As we age biological systems from the molecular to the macroscopic undergo functional decline.
This increasingly impaired function with time results in increased risk for a wide variety of chronic disease states and indeed for co-morbidities with these conditions <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Partridge2018" role="doc-biblioref">288</a>]</span>.
Among the molecular changes that occur with age are alterations to the epigenome <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Booth2016" role="doc-biblioref">30</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Approximately 45% of the human genome is comprised of repetitive or transposable elements <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Deniz2019" role="doc-biblioref">404</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Kazazian2017" role="doc-biblioref">405</a>]</span> (Figure <a href="Alus.html#fig:propRepeats">5.1</a>).
The repression of these elements to prevent their expansion or the impact of their latent regulatory potential from effecting genomic stability and regulation is a core function of epigenetic mechanisms <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Gregory2005" role="doc-biblioref">406</a>]</span>.
The most common DNA modification, 5-methylcytosine (5mC) at CpG loci, exhibits the most well documented age-related changes, and plays a central role in the repression of repetitive and transposable elements <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Lopez-Otin2013" role="doc-biblioref">11</a>]</span>.
DNA methylation also classically functions to repress gene expression at promoters <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Deaton2011" role="doc-biblioref">407</a>]</span>, similar to the repressive role that is plays at repetitive elements.
Beyond solely repressive effects, DNA methylation in gene bodies can modulate expression <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Hellman2007" role="doc-biblioref">408</a>]</span> and influence splicing patterns <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Shukla2011" role="doc-biblioref">409</a>]</span>.</p>

<p>Demethylation of repetitive elements is thought to be a major contributor to the global decreases in bulk 5mC with age <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Wilson1983" role="doc-biblioref">138</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Bollati2010" role="doc-biblioref">411</a>]</span>.

<p>Alu elements are the single most abundant transposon in the human genome with ~1.19 million copies and comprising ~10.7% of the total genomic sequence <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Dewannieux2003" role="doc-biblioref">412</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Deininger2011" role="doc-biblioref">413</a>]</span>.
Alu elements are members of the short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) family of non-LTR retrotransposons, are ~300bp in length, and are derived from the 7SL RNA gene <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Ullu1984" role="doc-biblioref">414</a>]</span>.
SINEs are non-autonomous, unlike LINEs (short interspersed nuclear elements) they do not encode their own reverse transcriptase (RT) but instead replicate making use of an RT encoded in an active LINE element, such as one of the small number of active LINE-1 elements <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Deininger2011" role="doc-biblioref">413</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Cordaux2009" role="doc-biblioref">415</a>]</span>.
The Alu elements arose from the 7SL sequence via the FAM sequences, which gave rise to truncated variants, FRAM and FLAM the fusion of which yielded the current dimeric Alu sequence <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Quentin1992" role="doc-biblioref">416</a>]</span>.</p>

<p>Alu elements are CpG rich (Figure <a href="Alus.html#fig:AlusWindowsCpGdLVplot">5.4</a>), accounting for ~7.5 million CpGs, or ~25% of all human CpG sites (Figure <a href="Alus.html#fig:clockRepeatCpGs">5.5</a>) <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Deininger2011" role="doc-biblioref">413</a>]</span>.
High levels of DNA methylation predominate at Alu elements across normal tissues.
Furthermore Alu elements are more resistant to hypomethylation than other repetitive elements in cancer cells.
This is indicative of strong pressure to maintain their repressed state <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Jorda2017" role="doc-biblioref">410</a>]</span>.</p>

<p>Alu elements contain many sequences with the potential to effect gene regulation, and indeed do effect gene expression <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Chen2017b" role="doc-biblioref">421</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-RobertoFerrari2019" role="doc-biblioref">422</a>]</span>.
There are numerous TFBSs in the canonical sequences of elements in the Alu family <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Polak2006" role="doc-biblioref">423</a>]</span>, and some may possess enhancer activity <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Su2014" role="doc-biblioref">424</a>]</span>.
DNA methylation levels at transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) modulate the binding affinity of transcription factors for these sites <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Yin2017" role="doc-biblioref">88</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Blattler2014" role="doc-biblioref">425</a>]</span>.
Thus deterioration in the effectiveness of the repression of Alu elements has the potential to disruptively expose this latent regulatory function <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Chuong2017" role="doc-biblioref">290</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Ward2013" role="doc-biblioref">426</a>â€“<a href="references.html#ref-Zhang2019" role="doc-biblioref">428</a>]</span>.
Epigenetic reactivation of cryptic cis-regulatory elements (CREs) within transposons has been show to act as an oncogenic driver <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Jang2019" role="doc-biblioref">429</a>]</span>, including specifically from Alu elements <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Rajendiran2016" role="doc-biblioref">430</a>]</span>.
Alu element methylation has also previously been correlated with age-related phenotypes.
Hypomethylation of Alu elements in blood cells has been associated with increasing age and with lower bone mass <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Jintaridth2013" role="doc-biblioref">431</a>]</span>.
Alu and LINE-1 elements were more methylated in the circulating cell-free DNA of women with an older age an menopause <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Lu2018a" role="doc-biblioref">432</a>]</span>.
De-repression of Alu elements also has the potential to influence common non-malignant diseases including neurodegenerative and auto immune conditions <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Chuong2017" role="doc-biblioref">290</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Payer2017" role="doc-biblioref">433</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Statistical methods for sparse regression analysis combined with quantitative assays of DNA methylation with high positional resolution, which cover a large number of loci, have permitted the construction of â€˜DNA methylation clocksâ€˜ which predict chronological age with a high degree of accuracy <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Horvath2018" role="doc-biblioref">293</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Bell2019" role="doc-biblioref">434</a>]</span>.
The difference between chronological and predicted age know as the â€™age accelerationâ€™ has been found to capture aspects of biological ageing in a number of these clocks.
For example, Age acceleration is a strong predictor of all-cause mortality <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Marioni2015" role="doc-biblioref">190</a>]</span>.
Whilst DNA hypermethylation and hypomethylation are driven by distinct mechanisms <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Wu2017" role="doc-biblioref">101</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Mozhui2017" role="doc-biblioref">435</a>]</span> CpGs undergoing these processes are approximately equally represented in DNA methylation clocks.
Interestingly however, hypomethylating CpGs were identified by Zhang et al.Â to be the most indicative of biological ageing-related all-cause mortality effects in blood <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Zhang2017" role="doc-biblioref">436</a>]</span>.
Most DNA methylation clocks constructed in humans have been constructed using the Illumina bead chip array based DNA methylation assays.
The coverage of these assays is strongly focused on promoters <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Bibikova2009" role="doc-biblioref">154</a>]</span>, CpG islands <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Bibikova2011" role="doc-biblioref">162</a>]</span>, and more recently enhancers <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Moran2015" role="doc-biblioref">210</a>]</span>.
However, array coverage of repetitive elements is lacking due in part to the technical challenges of accurate mapping in these spaces <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Bell2019" role="doc-biblioref">434</a>]</span>.
Despite this, a small number of CpGs in repeat elements are present in existing DNA methylation age clocks (Figure <a href="Alus.html#fig:clockRepeatCpGs">5.5</a>).
Thus, much of the genomic hypomethylation goes uncovered by the assays most commonly used to construct human epigenetic clocks.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.5</span> Binarisation</h3>
<p>In Alu age prediction model for which Binarisation was used the binarisation of DNA methylation data was achieved by a simple procedure: assigning windows in a given sample a DNA methylation value of 1 if their DNA methylation value was greater than the median RPM value for this window across samples and a 0 if it was less.</p>
<p>Binarisation of gene expression data yielded increased predictive accuracy in gene expression based ageing clocks <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Meyer2020" role="doc-biblioref">442</a>]</span>.
The reasoning behind this approach is that the quantitation of changes in gene expression is noisy and binarising the data may reduce the noise whilst retaining the information important for age prediction.
Whilst this approach discards information about the level of expression, sacrificing power, its success in transcription data indicate that it makes up for this possibly through greater consistency between samples reducing overfitting to misleading technical noise.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Results</h2>
<p>A variety of different initial filtering criteria were applied to the Alu elements included in the models, as well as a number of data transformations.
Pre-filtering steps were performed partially for quality control and partially to see if subsets of the Alu space with biologically interesting differences could yield clocks of equivalent accuracy but which might capture different aspects of biological ageing related to repeat de-repression.</p>
<p>Preliminary analysis were carried out using RPM values, Quantile normalised RPM values, Absolute methylation value estimates from <code>MEDIPS</code> and Binarised DNA methylation data.
Quantile normalised RPM values yielded the best and most consistent results and were used in subsequent analyses.</p>
<p>Whilst Human epigenetic age is logarithmic with time across the lifespan the effects of this are more relevant at younger ages <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Snir2019" role="doc-biblioref">448</a>]</span>.
We fitted Alu Clock models on the natural logarithm of age in years this did not improve the quality of predicted to actual age values, likely due in part to the older age distribution of our data.</p>
<p>An Alu element length filter of at least 180bp or approximately two-thirds the length of a full length Alu element (~280bp) was imposed.
This minimises the number of reads with the potential to misalign to other Alu elements, reads which, in this context, could lead to reduced accuracy of positionally specific Alu DNA methylation estimates <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Hellen2013" role="doc-biblioref">449</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>CpG density filters were employed to prioritise regions likely to have dynamic and functionally interesting differences in DNA methylation.
Filters were used for CpG densities above the genomic background of 2%, as well as for &gt;5% the approximate threshold for CpG island shores and low methylation regions <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Stadler2011" role="doc-biblioref">84</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Irizarry2009" role="doc-biblioref">85</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>To limit the selection of predictive sites to those likely to have consistent directions of change across samples a clock was constructed with only windows which show nominally significant changes in both members of an MZ twin pair in a consistent direction.
Linear models to predict age based on DNA methylation were fitted for 687 pairs of monozygotic (MZ) twins.
Batch information and blood cell counts (eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils) were included as covariates.</p>
<p>To produce a model that specifically captures age as a function of the de-repression of Alu elements clocks were also constructed with only windows which exhibited nominally significant (p &lt; 0.05) decreases in DNAm in both MZ twins.
This filtering was based on the model used in selecting windows with a consistent direction of change.</p>
<p>An age predictor was also constructed using only AluY elements.
AluY is the youngest (Figure <a href="Alus.html#fig:AluAge">5.3</a>), and most CpG dense (Figure <a href="Alus.html#fig:AlusWindowsCpGdLVplot">5.4</a>) family of Alu elements.
Having a CpG density closer to that of typically de-repressed functional elements may make such elements more readily susceptible to stable de-repression.
In addition the host genome has had less time to adapt to the presence of these elements so their de-repression may be more disruptive than older elements.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="Alus.html#fig:modelSummaryTabsMain">5.9</a> summarises the details of Alu clocks trained with these various pre-filtering criteria applied to their starting sets.
The correlation with the predicted age and the chronological age of samples unrelated to the individuals on which the clock was trained indicate model quality (Figure <a href="Alus.html#fig:corplotsPanelSplit">5.11</a> a).
The quality of the Alu clock predictions is quite poor in comparison to other DNA methylation clocks with the highest R of 0.65 and a median absolute error of 8.1 years, compared to 0.96 and 3.6 years for Horvathâ€™s multi-tissue clock <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Horvath2013" role="doc-biblioref">168</a>]</span>.</p>

The correlations are mostly slightly higher for this prediction than for the prediction of unrelated individuals (Figure <a href="Alus.html#fig:corplotsPanelSplit">5.11</a> b).

<div id="Alu-Discussion" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.5</span> Discussion</h2>
<p>The Alu Age predictors do not fulfill the Horvath &amp; Raj criteria to be classified as an epigentic clock <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Horvath2018" role="doc-biblioref">293</a>]</span>, namely that they should have an r &gt; 0.8.</p>
<p>The age acceleration of the Alu age predictors is strongly correlated with age.
This may be due the the relatively poor ability of MeDIP-seq to provide absolute quantitation of DNA methylation.
There is substantial technical noise in the value representing DNA methylation at a given locus.
The observed systematic bias towards underestimating the ages of the young and overestimating the ages of the old may be explained by a broadly consistent direction with an inconsistent magnitude.
Simply scaling the value of given locus by a fixed model coefficient when there is a large amount of variation leads to outsized influence of high magnitude outliers on the age estimates.
A DNA methylation age clock trained on the entire genome and not restricted to a particular subset such as the Alu elements should yield the optimal age predictor possible using the MeDIP-seq dataset if there is adequate cross-validation when training the elastic net regression.
Comparison to this predictor would reveal if the limitations of the Alu age predictor are specific to it or a more general issue with age predictors based on this dataset.</p>
<p>This strong correlation between Alu age acceleration and chronological age means that age is a substantial confounding factor in the GWAS for Alu age acceleration.
Consequently the effect of chronological age cannot be readily disentangled from any signature of biological ageing captured by the Alu repeat based age predictors constructed here.</p>
<p>It was an aim of this work to investigate the genetic influences on the Alu clock based measures of age-acceleration, as has been shown previously with an association in the TERT gene with the Horvath clock <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Lu2017" role="doc-biblioref">459</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Gibson2019" role="doc-biblioref">460</a>]</span>.
Interestingly none of the SNPs identified at <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; 1\times10^{-5}\)</span> in either of the two models was present in the list of those identified in a recent GWAS conducted for the age acceleration of several other DNA methylation age clocks <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Mccartney2020" role="doc-biblioref">461</a>]</span>.
This could suggest that the Alu Age acceleration signature is associating with distinct genetic effects to those of other DNA methylation base age predictors.
These results have the potential to reveal mechanisms involved in controlling the epigenetic state of this large portion of the genome.
However the strong relationship with Age acceleration and Chronological age in the Alu clock measures of age acceleration renders this difficult as age is a potent confounder of age acceleration in this instance.
The results of the genome wide association study whilst they are suggestive of some interesting age related genetic associations do not necessarily represent associations with age acceleration signatures in the Alu repeat regions of the human genome.
A GWAS conducted on Chronolgical Age would likely results that differed between the age strata within the cohort which would not be relevant to the question of biological ageing.
Thus the associations in the GWAS for Alu age acceleration could be due to population stratification by age in the GWAS study population.
GWAS for Longevity have identified very few consistent results with only APOE and FOXO3 replicating in independent studies <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Broer2015" role="doc-biblioref">25</a>]</span>.
None of 143 unique SNPs from the the 2 GWAS conducted here are shared with the set of top longevity associated SNPs in a meta analysis of longevity GWAS <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Broer2015" role="doc-biblioref">25</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Direct comparison between DNA methylation array probes and the MeDIP-seq windows used in the Alu clock is not straightforward due to the gaps in coverage of the array, the lack of CpG specific positional resolution and the lack of an absolute unit of methylation level in the MeDIP-seq data.
With over a million Alu loci an individually targeted approach to quantifying genome wide Alu element DNA methylation levels would be expensive and impractical.
If enzymatic conversion alternatives to bisulfite sequencing methods permit whole genome DNA methylation assays to be performed more cheaply and with longer reads improving mappability <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Williams2019" role="doc-biblioref">135</a>]</span>, then data generated with this approach may permit an Alu DNA methylation clock with greater accuracy in the future.</p>
