<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> The Ageing Population and The Burden of Disease</h2>
<p>The global population is ageing as is evident from the changing shape of the world population pyramid (figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:poppyramid">1.1</a>).
The increase in average lifespan underlying this demographic shift is projected to continue in industrialised nations with a probability of &gt;65% for women and 85% for men <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Kontis2017" role="doc-biblioref">2</a>]</span> (figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:Kontis2017-fig1">1.2</a>).
Ageing is the main risk factor for cancer, cardiovascular, neurodegenerative diseases, and many other conditions including osteoarthritis <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Niccoli2012" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>]</span>. Furthermore, mortality from these conditions increases according to a logistic function with age <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Belikov2019" role="doc-biblioref">4</a>]</span> (figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:Belikov2019-fig1">1.3</a>).
In addition to the non-infectious diseases, immunosenescence and frailty in old age contribute to increased mortality from infectious diseases, as exemplified by dramatically higher hospital admissions and deaths for respiratory disease during seasonal flu epidemics in the over 75s <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Fleming2005" role="doc-biblioref">5</a>]</span> (figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:Fleming2005-fig3">1.4</a>).
Ageing is a common underlying risk factor for many conditions and as this would lead one to expect the number of concomitant disorders and the proportion of persons with multiple morbidities increases with age <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Barnett2012" role="doc-biblioref">6</a>]</span> (figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:Barnett2012-fig1">1.5</a>).</p>

<p>Given the rapid increases in the rates of numerous diseases and the rate of death from those diseases as we age, there is a clear impetus to develop interventions to prevent and treat age-related diseases.
The common factor among all these conditions is their relationship to age, but age is not merely a shared risk factor but frequently the largest; outside of rare genetic conditions which predispose to early-onset <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Niccoli2012" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>]</span>.
Thus understanding the underlying biological mechanisms of the ageing process and intervening in those mechanisms, has the potential to be vastly more effective and economical <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Goldman2016" role="doc-biblioref">8</a>]</span> than attempting to tackle diseases individually.
The discovery in 1993 by Cynthia Kenyon and others <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Kenyon1993" role="doc-biblioref">9</a>]</span> that a single mutation in the <em>daf-2</em> gene of <em>C. elegans</em> could double the lifespan of this organism is often cited as an inflexion point in the confidence of the ageing research field that interventions in the process of ageing itself may be a realistic therapeutic target. What then do we know about the underlying biology of ageing?</p>
</div>
<div id="the-biology-of-ageing" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> The biology of Ageing</h2>
<p>Ageing is characterised by a progressive deterioration of physiological integrity with time, resulting in an increased risk of mortality and morbidity.
Theories of how and why this occurs are numerous with a history in the scientific literature stretching back to the late 1800s <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Medvedev1990" role="doc-biblioref">10</a>]</span>, setting aside, for now, theoretical frameworks for the process of ageing we will first consider the nature of these changes.
Changes at the organismal level have their origins in changes at the molecular and cellular scales. Lopez-Otin et al. 2013 <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Lopez-Otin2013" role="doc-biblioref">11</a>]</span> identified nine hallmarks of ageing in their 2013 review.
These hallmarks meet the criteria of:
Manifesting during normal ageing;
Accelerating ageing when aggravated;
Retarding ageing when ameliorated.
The hallmarks are further subdivided and hierarchically arranged into primary, antagonistic and integrative categories.
Primary hallmarks are of unequivocally negative effect.
Antagonistic hallmarks arise as a response to the primary and are initially protective against these changes but become problems in their own right as they occur at higher levels over time.
Lastly, the integrative hallmarks directly impact on tissue function and homoeostasis.
The hallmarks are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Primary Hallmarks - Causes of Damage</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><em>Genomic instability</em>:
Damage to the genomes of our cells occurs over time and accumulates as we age, this damage ranges from point mutations to large structural mutations, as well as mutations in the mitochondrial genome.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Telomere attrition</em>:
Telomere shortening occurs during the ageing process, somatic cells do not generally express telomerase so with each division telomeres grow shorter.
Telomere exhaustion limits the replicative capacity of cells inducing replicative senescence, limiting regenerative potential but also protecting from the uncontrolled growth of cancer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Epigenetic alterations</strong>:
Patterns of DNA methylation and of a number of histone modifications exhibit age-related changes. These contribute to the dysregulation of gene expression and derepression of heterochromatin regions which also increases the risk of genomic instability.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Loss of proteostasis</em>:
Production of protein folding chaperones in response to stress decreases with age, as does the activity of the two major proteolytic systems, the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the autophagy-lysosome system.
This leads to increased prevalence of misfolded, aberrant and aggregated proteins with age.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Antagonistic Hallmarks - Responses to damage</strong></p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><em>Deregulated nutrient sensing</em>:
The IIS (insulin &amp; insulin-like growth signalling) and TOR (Target Of Rapamycin) pathways signal nutrient abundance, promoting anabolism.
The AMPK (5’ adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) and Sirtuins signal nutrient scarcity, promoting catabolism.
Broadly speaking inhibiting the pro-anabolic pathways and activating the pro-catabolic pathways can extend lifespan.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Mitochondrial dysfunction</em>:
Mitochondrial ATP production drops off with and ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) production increases. Elevated ROS do not appear to accelerate ageing nor do elevated antioxidants retard it.
Indicating the primary function of ROS in ageing is not straightforwardly a result of oxidative damage, but may result from its role in stress signalling.
Dysfunctional mitochondria exhibit an increased propensity to polarise in response to stress, impacting on apoptotic signalling and inflammatory responses.
This contributes to the increases in senescent cells and their chronic inflammatory phenotype.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Cellular senescence</em>:
Senescent cells are in stable cell-cycle arrest induced by shortened telomeres, other forms of DNA damage, INK4/ARF derepression, or a variety of mitogenic/oncogenic signals.
Induction of a senescent state in pre-cancerous cells protects against cancer and senescent cells are initially cleared by the immune system.
However, these cells accumulate in tissue as we age without contributing to function and with a pro-inflammatory secretory phenotype that promotes chronic inflammation <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Avelar2020" role="doc-biblioref">12</a>]</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Integrative Hallmarks - Proximal Causes of the Ageing phenotype</strong></p>
<ol start="8" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><em>Stem cell exhaustion</em>:
Adult stem cells capable of producing new cells for the regeneration of tissues undergo asymmetric divisions to replace themselves and produce replicative progenitor cells to replenish tissue.
Stem cells may accumulate damage and cease replicating or leave their quiescent state becoming overly replicative and potentially becoming senescent.
This disrupts the supply of new cells for the renewal of tissue.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Altered intercellular communication</em>:
The aforementioned cell-autonomous alterations alter external signalling behaviour of cells across intercellular signalling paradigms.
This can lead to feedback loops that exacerbate the problem. The high background of pro-inflammatory signals from senescent cells dilutes already declining immune response and fewer senescent cells are cleared.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This work and therefore the following review of the literature focuses on the 3rd hallmark, epigenetic alterations, specifically the role of DNA methylation in ageing.
Booth &amp; Brunet <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Booth2016" role="doc-biblioref">13</a>]</span> contend that epigenetic processes are a hub through which all of the other hallmarks of ageing are mediated and feed-back on one another (Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:Booth2016fig3">1.6</a>).
One of these interactions is between DNA damage and chromatin state including DNA methylation.
Sinclair and Oberdoerffer <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Sinclair2009" role="doc-biblioref">14</a>]</span> make the case that DNA damage and repair processes are disruptive to the epigenome and, with Hayano et al., link double-stranded DNA breaks to accelerated epigenetic ageing in a recent pre-print <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Hayano2019" role="doc-biblioref">15</a>]</span>.
Kane &amp; Sinclair <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Kane2019" role="doc-biblioref">16</a>]</span> make the case that reprogramming of the epigenome to a ‘younger’ state is a promising mode of intervention in the ageing process.
Whilst loss of genetic information is effectively irreversible, barring gene therapy-like interventions, loss of epigenetic information is not necessarily so.
Dysregulation from the loss of epigenetic information is arguably proximate to age-related changes and may run ahead of significant genetic information loss such that intervening in the former may have beneficial effects in its own right and stave off the latter.</p>

<p>Prior to examining the specific relationship of epigenetic changes to ageing we take a step back to define and outline epigenomics and examine the fundamentals of DNA methylation biology.</p>
</div>
<div id="epigenomics---overview" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Epigenomics - Overview</h2>
<p>Epigenetics generally refers to modifications to DNA and chromatin which do not affect the primary sequence of DNA bases <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Bird2007" role="doc-biblioref">17</a>]</span>, but which are to varying degrees stable and heritable.
The term derives from epigenesis and genetics originating with Conrad Waddington <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Waddington1942" role="doc-biblioref">18</a>]</span>.
Epigenesis refers to the idea that organisms develop through the progressive differentiation of cells from the egg into adult tissues.
As modern genetics revealed that every cell contained a complete copy of the genome which was differentially utilised by the cells of adult organisms, the terms were fused to reflect the study of how this occurs.
The usage has evolved a little further since molecular biology began to elucidate the mechanisms involved in this process and the term now frequently refers to the study of these mechanisms and their effects in less explicitly developmental contexts.
Arthur Riggs et al. considered that heritability should be a criterion for a mark to be considered epigenetic, but this excludes many phenomena now commonly referred to using the term <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Russo1996" role="doc-biblioref">19</a>]</span>.
Requiring heritability results in a further definitional dispute over degrees of heritability; mitotic, meiotic, intergenerational, transgenerational and to what degree of fidelity?
Adrian Bird proposed the definition: “the structural adaptation of chromosomal regions so as to register, signal or perpetuate altered activity states.” as a useful compromise <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Bird2007" role="doc-biblioref">17</a>]</span>.
Epigenomics refers to the totality of the epigenetic modifications present in a particular cell, tissue type or genome.
This definition appears to have caught on with at least some as: ‘These days, “epigenetics” more generally refers to all non-genomic information storage in cells including gene networks, chromatin structure and post-translational modifications to histones.’, according to Alice Kane and David Sinclair <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Kane2019" role="doc-biblioref">16</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Whilst an organism can generally be thought of as having a single genome, with exceptions such as Somatic mutations and Chimerism, it will have at least as many epigenomes as it has cell types <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Tabansky2015" role="doc-biblioref">20</a>]</span>.
There are on the order of <span class="math inline">\(10^{13}\)</span> cells in the human body <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Bianconi2013" role="doc-biblioref">21</a>]</span>.
Estimates of the number of cell types vary with the resolution at which one deems cells functionally distinct <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Regev2017" role="doc-biblioref">22</a>]</span>.
At this point in time, however, there is no clear definition of what constitutes a distinct cell type, indeed they are beginning to be defined by the distinct patterns of gene expression and epigenetic modifications they exhibit <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-CellSystemsCellType2017" role="doc-biblioref">23</a>]</span>.
Consequently, the number epigenomes that could be considered distinct will likely ultimately approximate to the number of epigenomes which can usefully distinguish between sub-populations of cells.
A consortium has been established to produce a <a href="www.humancellatlas.org">Human Cell Atlas</a> <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Regev2017" role="doc-biblioref">22</a>]</span> which aims to define all human cell types, and a cell type ontology <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-CellOntologyOBO" role="doc-biblioref">24</a>]</span> exists.</p>
<p>There are a number of epigenetic modifications which can be subdivided into four broad categories:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>DNA modifications</strong></p>
<p>In mammals DNA methylation primarily takes place on Cytosine residues.
Cytosine methylation occurs principally in an mCpG sequence context but can also occur in mCpH, mCHG and mCHH (H=A/C/T) contexts; particularly in cells of the nervous system <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Guo2014a" role="doc-biblioref">25</a>]</span> and embryonic stem cells where as many as 25% of all cytosines can be methylated in non-canonical contexts.
In contrast to methylation in a differentiated non-neuronal tissue such as foetal lung fibroblasts which is 99.98% in CpG context <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Lister2009" role="doc-biblioref">26</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Schultz2015" role="doc-biblioref">27</a>]</span>.
5-methylcytosine (5mc) can be oxidised to produce another modified DNA base 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Penn1972" role="doc-biblioref">28</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Kriaucionis2009" role="doc-biblioref">29</a>]</span>.
5hmC may act as an intermediate to demethylation and potentially has regulatory functions in its own right <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Pfeifer2013" role="doc-biblioref">30</a>]</span>.
5hmC can be oxidised further to formylcytosine (5fC) and carboxylcytosine (5caC) <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Ito2011" role="doc-biblioref">31</a>]</span>.
The extent to which these modifications are stable and functional is still being explored.
Other DNA bases can be methylated such as N6-methyladenine, but this occurs at a substantially lower frequency that 5mC and much less is known about their potential functions <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Wu2016" role="doc-biblioref">32</a>]</span>.
N6-methyladenine may play a role in condensing chromatin <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Xie2018" role="doc-biblioref">33</a>]</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Histone tail modifications</strong></p>
<p>Histone proteins form disk-shaped octamers around which ~150bp of DNA can be wrapped to form a nucleosome.
The ‘tails’ are generally the N termini of the histone proteins, outside of the core globular domains, which protrude from the nucleosome structure <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Losick2014" role="doc-biblioref">34</a>]</span>.
Histone tails can be subject to post-translational modification which commonly takes place at lysine residues, other residues are subject to modifications but lysines are among the best characterised.
Examples of modifications include methylation with between one and three methyl groups per lysine, Acetylations, Ubiquitylation, SUMOylations, and phosphorylations <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Bannister2011" role="doc-biblioref">35</a>]</span>.
Many of these marks can be generally classified as permissive or repressive but are frequently found in combinations of marks of opposing effect, rendering the interpretation of the ‘Histone Code’ extremely challenging <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Strahl2000" role="doc-biblioref">36</a>–<a href="references.html#ref-Voigt2012" role="doc-biblioref">38</a>]</span>.
One approach to interpreting chromatin state is segmentation.
Segmentation makes use of pattern discovery techniques to divide the genome into discrete sections assigning these sections to a set of categories which can then be compared to existing annotations to provide functional labels <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Hoffman2012" role="doc-biblioref">39</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Carrillo-de-Santa-Pau2017" role="doc-biblioref">40</a>]</span>.
When successful the pattern discovery algorithm independently recapitulates our existing ontology of functional elements and hopefully provides new insights by for example highlighting regions not previously considered to be in a given functional category.
This is a “top-down” approach making use of the “sum” of available chromatin state data rather than trying to interpret the significance of a single type of mark.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Histone Variants</strong></p>
<p>Alternatives to the canonical histones can be substituted in the nucleosome, examples of such alternative histones include H2A.Z and H3.3 <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Talbert2012" role="doc-biblioref">41</a>]</span>.
Alternative histones can alter chromatin structure and dynamics by altering nucleosome stability, binding different factors, and presenting a different substrate for histone modifications, thus altering their pattern <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Weber2014" role="doc-biblioref">42</a>]</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Some non-coding RNAs (ncRNA)</strong></p>
<p>A subset of long ncRNAs, particularly those which persist in close association with chromatin can fall within the definition of epigenetic features <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Kaikkonen2011" role="doc-biblioref">43</a>]</span>.
An example of such a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is Xist which is a key regulator of X inactivation <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Cerase2015" role="doc-biblioref">44</a>]</span>.
The catagorisation of these as epigenetic is somewhat controversial, as they are not direct chemical modifications to chromatin. However Xist, for example, facilitates the mitotically heritable repression of the inactivate X chromosome satisfying other criteria for being considered an epigenetic modification.</p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Fundamentals of DNA Methylation</h2>
<div id="structure-and-context" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.1</span> Structure and Context</h3>
<p>DNA methylation is the most well-studied epigenetic modification <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Haluskova2010" role="doc-biblioref">45</a>]</span>.
Specifically CpG methylation, the addition of a Methyl group to the 5 carbon of a cytosine base (figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:5mCvsC">1.7</a>), in a CpG dinucleotide context (figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:CpGvsGpC">1.8</a>).
(hereafter ‘DNA Methylation’ or ‘DNAm’ refers to 5mC CpG methylation unless stated otherwise.)
DNA methylation is stable and relatively easy to characterise from biological samples by comparison with other epigenetic marks.
The methylation status of ancient DNA has even been characterised, for example, native American remains ranging in age from 230 to 4500 years were measured using bisulfite sequencing <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Smith2015" role="doc-biblioref">46</a>]</span>.
C undergoes spontaneous hydrolytic deamination over time to U, and 5mC to T.
once sufficient time has passed for the deamination process to convert the majority of the 5mC sites, this can be used to infer the methylation state of post-mortem DNA using DNA polymerases that cannot bypass uracils and thus only causes C <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> T misincorporation events at former 5mC loci.
This approach was employed to estimate the age at death of a a 4000 year of old Paleo-Eskimo belonging to the Saqqaq culture <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Pedersen2014" role="doc-biblioref">47</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>5mC is quite chemically stable such that for most tissue sample preservation techniques for which DNA can be extracted from the sample DNAm can also be characterised <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Briggs2010" role="doc-biblioref">48</a>]</span>.
DNA extracted with normal laboratory methods can be assayed for DNAm.
Histone modification status, on the other hand, is less robust against environmental stresses on samples and often requires considerably more laborious sample preparation to characterise <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Bauden2017" role="doc-biblioref">49</a>]</span>.
DNA methylation also offers the appearance of relative simplicity in comparison to the complex picture of the ‘histone code’, the simple binary nature of DNA methylation state makes it easier to model and possibly to interpret.
However, interaction between DNAm and histone modifications is well documented <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Hashimshony2003" role="doc-biblioref">50</a>–<a href="references.html#ref-Rose2014" role="doc-biblioref">52</a>]</span>, this interplay between DNAm and histone modifications renders the interpretation of DNAm more complex, as its effects may be conditional on the chromatin environment.</p>

<p>There are 28,299,634 CpGs <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Luo2014" role="doc-biblioref">53</a>]</span> in the hg19 assembly of the human genome <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Lander2001" role="doc-biblioref">54</a>]</span>.
Given that the GC content of the human genome is <span class="math inline">\(42\%\)</span> the prior probability of getting a CpG dinucleotide is: <span class="math inline">\(0.21 \times 0.21 = 0.0441\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(4.41\%\)</span>.

Methylated cytosines are prone to deamination to thymines, resulting in mismatch lesions where a T is opposite a G.

<p>CpGs are not uniformly distributed in the genome, they occur at higher frequency in some regions.
“CpG islands” or CGIs are regions of high CpG density.
They are defined somewhat arbitrarily, the definition used by UCSC is a sliding 500bp window <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Wu2010" role="doc-biblioref">56</a>]</span>.
There have existed other definitions <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Gardiner-Garden1987" role="doc-biblioref">57</a>]</span>.
The total number of CpGs in the UCSC repeat masked CGI annotation list of 28,691 CGIs is 1,990,729.
Therefore, these CpGs comprise <span class="math inline">\(\sim7.0\%\)</span> of the total number of CpGs the genome. The mean percentage of the sequence of these CGIs that is comprised of CpG dinucleotides is <span class="math inline">\(\sim18.5\%\)</span> and their mean length is 761bp.
CGIs overlap the promoters of <span class="math inline">\(\sim70\%\)</span> of genes <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Saxonov2006" role="doc-biblioref">58</a>]</span>, this, however, leaves roughly half of all CGIs as “orphans” not associated with a known transcription site.
These orphan CGIs frequently constitute cell-type specific enhancers <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Bell2017" role="doc-biblioref">59</a>]</span> and alternate promoters <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Illingworth2010" role="doc-biblioref">60</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Maunakea2010" role="doc-biblioref">61</a>]</span>.
They are found in both intergenic and intragenic regions.
CpGs are distributed quite sparsely through the genome occurring at low density in “seas” and at increasing density in CGIs and their flanking regions, see figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:CGIs">1.9</a>.
It is a characteristic of CGIs that they are generally unmethylated.</p>
<p>Early work showed 70-80% of CpGs are constitutively methylated <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Ehrlich1982" role="doc-biblioref">62</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Bird2002" role="doc-biblioref">63</a>]</span> Stadler et al. produced a more detailed picture of the distribution of CpG methylation in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Stadler2011" role="doc-biblioref">64</a>]</span> see figures <a href="introduction.html#fig:Baubec2014fig1">1.10</a> &amp; <a href="introduction.html#fig:CpGfreqVsDNAm">1.11</a>.
Stadler et al. categorised …Mouse embryonic stem cells hidden markov model <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Stadler2011" role="doc-biblioref">64</a>]</span></p>
<p>Irizarry et al. found that the 2kb regions flanking CpG islands which they termed “CpG island shores” exhibited greater tissue-specific differential methylation than the islands themselves <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Irizarry2009" role="doc-biblioref">65</a>]</span>.
This nomenclature has subsequently been expanded further with “CpG island shelves” which are 2kb - 4kb from the CGIs, and “seas” referring to the rest of the genome, see figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:CGIs">1.9</a>.
Ziller et al. identified ~5.6 million CpGs dynamically regulated across diverse cell-types regions, these clustered into ~716,000 differentially methylated regions.
More that three quarters of these regions where under 1kb in size and located away from transcription start sites and &gt;70% of which had methylation levels &gt;75% <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Ziller2013" role="doc-biblioref">66</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Irizarry et al., Stadler et al. and Ziller et al. data indicate that the most dynamic DNA methylation changes are occurring at the level of small distal regulatory features.</p>

<p>The regulatory role played by DNA methylation varies with context and the scale at which it is examined.
For example methylation at a single CpG in a transcription factor binding site can determine whether or not the factor can bind at that site.
There are methylation-sensitive transcription factors which can have their affinity for DNA either increased or decreased by methylation <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Yin2017" role="doc-biblioref">68</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Zuo2017" role="doc-biblioref">69</a>]</span>.
In addition, larger-scale changes in DNAm can through interactions with chromatin modifiers alter DNA compaction and more general accessibility of DNA regions for binding, and/or impacting on their topological organisation.
DNAm also varies with nucleosome occupancy with lower methylation in linker sequences than on nucleosome-associated DNA <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Kelly2012" role="doc-biblioref">70</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Huff2014" role="doc-biblioref">71</a>]</span>.
The oxidation products of 5mC can also affect chromatin organisation, 5-Formylcytosine can impact nucleosome positioning through covalently binding to histones <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Raiber2017" role="doc-biblioref">72</a>]</span>.
This raises the question if some DNA methylation occurs specifically to act as an intermediate step for regulatory mechanisms which utilise its oxidation products.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.3</span> Pathways of DNA methylation and demethylation</h3>
<p>CpG methylation is produced and maintained by DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes.
All the DNMT enzymes use S-adenosylmethionine as the source of the methyl donor group.
DNMTs form a covalent intermediate between a conserved cysteine residue and the target base, through a nucleophilic attack on the C6 position in the cytosine ring <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Lyko2017" role="doc-biblioref">73</a>]</span>.
This is followed by the transfer of the S-adenosylmethionine methyl group to C5, and deprotonation of the C5 to reform the double bond between C5 and C6; which is mediated by a base provided by the enzyme (Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:Lyko2017DNAmMechanism">1.12</a>).</p>
<p>DNMT1 is associated with the replication machinery <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Vertino2002" role="doc-biblioref">74</a>]</span> and reproduces the methylation state of the parent strand on the daughter strand during replication.
The largest of the DNMT family DNMT1 contains a ‘replication foci targeting sequence’ (RFTS) domain required for its targeting to replication forks.
DNMT1 specialises in recognising hemimethylated DNA and methylating the unmethylated C in a palindromic CpG dinucleotide site, the UHRF1 protein assists in the recognition of these sequences <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Bostick2007" role="doc-biblioref">75</a>]</span>.
DNMT3a and DNMT3b are responsible for <em>de novo</em> DNA methylation along with DNMT3L a catalytically inactive, but DNA-binding subunit <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Jia2009" role="doc-biblioref">76</a>]</span>.
The location of <em>de novo</em> methylation by the DNMT3s is influenced by a number of factors including the Chromatin state and other DNA binding factors <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Lyko2017" role="doc-biblioref">73</a>]</span>.</p>

<p>DNMT2 is unlike the other members of the DNMT family in that it targets an RNA substrate.
DNMT2 is a tRNA methyltransferase which methylates a specific subset of tRNA genes, mostly Asp isoacceptors, at a site adjacent to the anticodon which protects them from endonucleolytic cleavage under stress conditions.
Unprotected tRNAs produce fragments which compete with small interfering RNAs interfering with their signalling pathways <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Kaiser2017" role="doc-biblioref">77</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>The mechanisms of the demethylation of DNA were more recently characterised than those which govern its methylation <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Ito2011" role="doc-biblioref">31</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Tahiliani2009" role="doc-biblioref">78</a>]</span>.
They are more complex and less well understood.
TET2 mutations are quite common in cancer, ranking 65th across 12 major cancer types <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Kandoth2013" role="doc-biblioref">79</a>]</span> and more common in diverse myeloid malignancies, where loss of its catalytic activity favours tumourigenesis <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Ko2010a" role="doc-biblioref">80</a>]</span>.
A distinction is drawn between active and passive demethylation, in passive demethylation, 5mC bases are diluted out in the process of DNA replication.
In the leading model of active demethylation, they are oxidised one or more times by an enzyme from the TET (Ten-Eleven-translocase) family.
They are then either passively removed by DNA replication or actively removed by a DNA glycosylase (thymine DNA glycosylase TGD) to create an apurinic site which is restored to a C by the Base Excision Repair (BER) pathway. This cycle of cytosine methylation and demethylation is illustrated in Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:Wu2017TETsDNAmCycle">1.13</a> <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Wu2017" role="doc-biblioref">81</a>]</span>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.4</span> Maintenance and Fidelity</h3>
<p>DNA methylation is highly dependent on the underlying DNA sequence.
Sequence features of particular importance to determining DNA methylation status are; transcription factor and other DNA binding protein recognition motifs, and CpG density <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Ziller2013" role="doc-biblioref">66</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Lienert2011" role="doc-biblioref">82</a>]</span>.
Alterations in underlying DNA sequence such as SNPs and copy number variants (CNVs) can have a significant impact on methylation level and the susceptibility of the methylation level to change.
In addition, CNVs can result in dosage effects on measures of DNAm, causing regions to appear, respectively, substantially more or less methylated when fewer or greater copies than expected are present <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Boks2009" role="doc-biblioref">83</a>–<a href="references.html#ref-Martin-Trujillo2017" role="doc-biblioref">88</a>]</span>.
Despite the strong influence of sequence on methylation, global CpG methylation exhibits change over developmental time as illustrated in figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:DNAmDevTime">1.14</a> and exhibits tissue-specific changes in distribution and amount <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Ziller2013" role="doc-biblioref">66</a>]</span>.</p>

<p>In mitosis, DNA methylation is inherited by daughter cells with an error rate on the order of <span class="math inline">\(1\times10^{-3}\)</span> per site per generation <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Ushijima2005" role="doc-biblioref">90</a>]</span>, several orders of magnitude less than that of DNA replication (error rate of <span class="math inline">\(1\times10^{-7}\)</span> - <span class="math inline">\(1\times10^{-8}\)</span> <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Kunkel2004a" role="doc-biblioref">91</a>]</span>).
The fidelity of DNA methylation copying can be assayed by Hairpin-Bisulfite PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Laird2004" role="doc-biblioref">92</a>]</span>.
Laird et al. looked at two alleles of a portion of the CpG island from the human <em>FMR1</em> gene in uncultured lymphocytes, one hypermethylated and one hypomethylated.
In the hypermethylated allele, they found that 96% of sites methylated in the parent strand remained methylated in the daughter strand and 86% of unmethylated sites remained unmethylated.
By contrast in the hypomethylated allele, there were no methylated sites to be retained and &gt;99% of unmethylated sites remained so following replication.
Laird et al.’s work suggests a higher degree of overall methylation fidelity for hypomethylated DNA and a propensity for unmethylated sites in hypermethylated DNA to become methylated.</p>
<p>Change in DNAm levels over time (divisions) can be modelled using the differential equations <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Pfeifer1990a" role="doc-biblioref">93</a>]</span>, which predict that a fully methylated site and a fully unmethylated site will converge on an equilibrium level.
This level is determined by the probability of maintenance of the methylation state and of <em>de novo</em> methylation for a given locus.
This stochastic model of DNAm is in agreement with experimental findings <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Laird2004" role="doc-biblioref">92</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Riggs2004a" role="doc-biblioref">94</a>]</span>, Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:Riggs2004PNASfig2DNAmFidelity">1.15</a>.</p>

<p>Jenkinson et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Jenkinson2017" role="doc-biblioref">95</a>]</span> used an information-theoretic approach, modelling DNAm as a binary communications channel using a 1-dimensional Ising model from the field of statistical physics.
This permitted them to examine properties of DNAm not accessible to conventional means of analysis which typically capture the mean methylation level and perhaps the variability for a given locus.
When considering methylation fidelity using this lens the maintenance of a given methylation state can be seen as an information processing task which requires the consumption of free energy in order to reduce the probability of error in the transmission of that methylation state.
Thus Relative Dissipated Energy (RDE) can serve as a measure of the work expended by a cell at a given locus in order to preserve the current methylation state of that locus.</p>
<p>Zhao et al <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Zhao2014" role="doc-biblioref">96</a>]</span> applied Hairpin-Bisulfite PCR genome-wide in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs).
They also found high degrees of methylation fidelity in hypomethylated regions such as CGIs and Promoters, as well as a high degree of fidelity in sites bound by transcription factors.
This is in agreement with the findings of Jenkinson et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Jenkinson2017" role="doc-biblioref">95</a>]</span> who noted that entropy (methylation stochasticity) was lower and more variable in CGIs and TSS (transcription start sites).</p>
<p>Methylation inheritance fidelity is reduced in cancer <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Ushijima2005" role="doc-biblioref">90</a>]</span> and increases with differentiation <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Zhao2014" role="doc-biblioref">96</a>]</span>.
The RDE (relative dissipated energy) at CGIs and TSSs is higher in differentiated tissues such as the brain, implying low entropy, and lower in embryonic stem cells, implying greater entropy <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Jenkinson2017" role="doc-biblioref">95</a>]</span> (see Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:Zhao2014fig3ab">1.16</a>).
In addition, the correlation between CpG sites increases in cancer <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Jenkinson2017" role="doc-biblioref">95</a>]</span>, suggesting reduced higher-level regulatory control and tendency to fall back on lower level feedback mechanisms leading to a return to the baseline equilibrium described above as the cell is expending less energy to maintain an out of equilibrium methylation state.</p>

<div id="dna-methylation-assays" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.5</span> DNA Methylation Assays</h3>
<p>There are numerous DNA methylation assays.
Some are designed to assay global DNAm levels producing a single global measurement of the amount of 5mC present in a sample, others assay DNAm in a manner traceable to a specific genomic locus.
These methods can be further subdivided into targeted methods where the loci to be examined are known in advance, and those where the loci covered are quasi-randomly sampled.
Both the targeted and untargeted methods vary in their granularity, from individual CpGs to large regions of the genome, on the order of megabases.
These assays also vary in their coverage of the genome from locus-specific approaches looking at small numbers of individual loci to whole-genome methods providing methylation information on all ~28 million CpG sites.
Between these two extremes are ‘epigenome-wide’ methods which are focused with varying degrees of specificity on genomic regions of interest.</p>
<p>These DNA methylation assays generally exploit one of four following principles:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Methylation sensitive restriction digestion</strong>
A variety of methods exploit enzymes which differentially cut methylated and unmethylated DNA.
An example of such enzymes is: HpaII and MspI which are isoschizomers for the sequence: 5’-C^CGG-3’ but only HpaII is methylation-sensitive and unable to cut the sequence if the internal cytosine is methylated.
The methods which use such enzymes include: Restriction landmark genomic scanning, which gives a roughly megabase resolution indicators of DNAm levels by 2D electrophoresis <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Hatada1991" role="doc-biblioref">98</a>]</span>.
MRE-seq, which makes use of methylation-sensitive restriction digests to enrich for unmethylated DNA <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Maunakea2010" role="doc-biblioref">61</a>]</span>.
This is then sequenced to provide the genomic location of this unmethylated signal.
Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS), which uses methylation-sensitive restriction digestion to enrich for unmethylated sequences which are then subject to bisulfite sequencing, (see point 3 below).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>DNA methylation-sensitive binding of DNA by antibodies or other proteins selectively which bind methylated DNA</strong>
Anti-5mC antibodies were first used to isolate methylated DNA in 1985 and were subsequently paired with array-based technologies to assay DNAm levels at specific loci in 2005 <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Weber2005" role="doc-biblioref">99</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Harrison2011" role="doc-biblioref">100</a>]</span>.
This was followed by MeDIP-seq (methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and sequencing) <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Down2009" role="doc-biblioref">101</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Lienhard2014" role="doc-biblioref">102</a>]</span>, which enriches methylated DNA that is then sequenced and the number of reads mapping to a locus is indicative of the relative methylation level.
MBD-seq uses a recombinant Methyl Binding Domain (MBD) protein to enrich for methylated double-stranded DNA, prior to sequencing <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Serre2009a" role="doc-biblioref">103</a>]</span>.
Inferring the absolute methylation levels form the number of reads mapping to a locus enriched by one of these pull-down methods is complicated by variation in CpG density in the genome and the fact that CpG dense regions tend to have low methylation levels, and thus tend not to be pulled down by antibodies binding 5mC or MBD proteins.
The best results for estimating absolute methylation levels with these methods come from pairing them with a complementary method to enrich for unmethylated sites such as MRE-seq (described above) <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Li2015" role="doc-biblioref">104</a>]</span>.
Though relative methylation levels remain effective in identifying differentially methylated regions when using these methods alone <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Maunakea2010" role="doc-biblioref">61</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Bock2010" role="doc-biblioref">105</a>]</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sodium bisulfite conversion of unmethylated cytosines to uracil</strong>
Conversion of cytosine to uracil changes the base complementary to this site from G to A <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Hayatsu1970" role="doc-biblioref">106</a>]</span>.
The basic chemistry of the conversion process is illustrated in Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:BisulfiteConversionNEB">1.17</a>.
This conversion can be detected with a variety of technologies such as:
The Illumina bead chip methylation arrays; WGBS; and Targeted bisulfite PCR or sequencing to examine a small number of selected loci.
It can also be performed on a larger number of loci with microfluidic multiplexing such as that provided by the Fluidigm access array <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Adamowicz2018" role="doc-biblioref">107</a>]</span>.
It is worth noting that bisulfite conversion cannot differentiate between methylated and hydroxymethylated cytosines.
Because 5hmC represents a small fraction of modified bases compared to 5mC many analyses have made the working assumption that unconverted bases are methylated, but it is beginning to be recognised that distinguishing between the two may be biologically important especially in tissues where 5hmC is more prevalent such as neurons.
A variant of bisulfite conversion, oxidative bisulfite conversion, exists which can permit 5hmC to be distinguished from 5mC <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Skvortsova2017" role="doc-biblioref">108</a>]</span>.
Additionally, New England Biolabs has recently developed an enzymatic alternative to chemical bisulfite conversion <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Williams2019" role="doc-biblioref">109</a>]</span></p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> DNA Methylation and Ageing</h2>
<p>Returning now to the relationship between DNA methylation and ageing we will review the major discoveries in that field, the roles thought to be played by DNAm in ageing and the utility of DNAm clocks as biomarkers of ageing.</p>
<p>Early work on DNA methylation and ageing used biochemical, chromatographic and radiolabeling techniques to assay global changes in the amount of 5mC.
These studies found differences in 5mC composition with cell type <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Ehrlich1982" role="doc-biblioref">62</a>]</span> but did not see changes with age.
Other work around that time however found differences in 5mC levels with the age of cells in culture <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Wilson1983" role="doc-biblioref">112</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Feinberg1983" role="doc-biblioref">113</a>]</span>.
Wilson et al. noted that DNA methylation decreased across several tens of generations of cell lines in culture, but not in immortal cell lines.
Immortal cell lines had lower absolute levels of 5mC to start with but remained constant over time.
Wilson et al. also cite earlier work by Romanov at al. 1981 <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Romanov1981" role="doc-biblioref">114</a>]</span> and Berdyshev el al. 1967 <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Berdyshev1967" role="doc-biblioref">115</a>]</span> which documented decreases in 5mC with age in cows and salmon, respectively.</p>
<p>Later work by Wilson et al. 1987 <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Wilson1987" role="doc-biblioref">116</a>]</span> in mice <em>P. leucopus</em> and <em>M. musculus</em> found decreases in 5mC with age and that the rate of decline was less in the longer-lived <em>P. leucopus</em> than in <em>M. musculus</em>.
Interestingly, a recent study using Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) by Cole et al. found no global differences between young and old mice in short and long-lived strains, however, their other observations would seem to corroborate these initial trends.
For the assayed sites long-lived mice exhibited 10x more hypermethylation than wild-type (WT), and WT mice had 3x more Differentially Methylated Regions significantly associated with age (DMRs/aDMRs) than did long-lived mice.
Notably, the WT and long-lived mice shared many of the same aDMRs which differed in their degree of methylation as opposed to affecting different sites in the genome <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Cole2017" role="doc-biblioref">117</a>]</span>.
The lack of apparent global changes may be due to the biases of the reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) method used.
RRBS uses a restriction enzyme-based approach to enrich for regions with high GC content such as CGIs which tend to have low levels of methylation, and consequently may not be sensitive to loss of methylation in generally hypermethylated regions which could contribute to a global trend <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Meissner2005" role="doc-biblioref">118</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Wilson et al. also noted that the mitotic index of tissues did not relate to the loss of DNA methylation with age in tension with their earlier observations <em>in vitro</em>.
The persistent loss of 5mC over time and the dramatic changes in methylation seen in cancer cells led Wilson et al. to suggest that dysregulation of DNA methylation may have a substantial role to play in the age-dependency of cancer risk and ageing more generally <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Feinberg2004" role="doc-biblioref">119</a>]</span>.
It has been suggested that “Epimutations” may be able to substitute for mutations in the multi-hit model of carcinogenesis <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Knudson1971" role="doc-biblioref">120</a>]</span>.
For example; hypermethylation of the <em>BRCA1</em> promoter <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Esteller2000" role="doc-biblioref">121</a>]</span>, Or, the development of Wilms’ tumour due to Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome, a disorder arising from loss of imprinting of the gene encoding insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) leading to a double dose of IGF-2 protein <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Feinberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">122</a>]</span>.
Furthermore, the loss of methylation and increased entropy of closed chromatin regions may lead to increased susceptibility to structural mutations commonly found in cancer cells through the exposure of homologous sequences <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Jenkinson2017" role="doc-biblioref">95</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Feinberg2004" role="doc-biblioref">119</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Methods which allowed the examination of changes in DNA methylation at known loci in the genome permitted a more nuanced picture of changes in DNA methylation over time to develop.
Fraga et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Fraga2005" role="doc-biblioref">123</a>]</span> introduced the concept of “epigenetic drift” being the divergence of DNA methylation and other epigenetic modification patterns with time.
Fraga et al. looked at the divergence in DNA methylation along with global Histone H3 and H4 acetylation patterns between monozygotic (MZ) twins over a wide range of ages.
They observed that older twins had greater epigenetic differences with time, in DNA methylation as well as H3, H4 Acetylation.
Fraga et al. also noted that the divergence in epigenetic state was greater in twins who had lived longer apart and had different medical histories.
Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:Fraga2005fig3">1.18</a> is a useful visual encapsulation of Fraga et al.’s DNA methylation results.
Slieker et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Slieker2016" role="doc-biblioref">124</a>]</span> identified 6366 CpGs whose methylation variability increased with age using the Illumina 450k array platform on whole-blood from 3295 individuals.
Both the increase in variability with age and the increasing divergence of twins support a narrative of epigenetic dysregulation and increasing entropy with age.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.1</span> Age-Related Differential Methylation and Epigenetic Clocks</h3>
<p>With the advent of array-based techniques which permitted the measurement of the methylation status of specific CpGs placed strategically throughout the genome, researchers were able to undertake a more fine-grained analysis of the changes in DNA methylation with age.
This has allowed the prediction of chronological age from a metric of “DNA methylation age” (DNAm age), and interpretation of the differences in predicted and chronological age in terms of the pathophysiology of ageing.</p>
<p>The Illumina Golden gate array <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Bibikova2006" role="doc-biblioref">125</a>]</span> with 1505 probes targeted to cancer-related genes was the first of these.
Bjornsson et al. observed DNAm changes with age as well as noting substantial intra-individual differences.
In contrast earlier work by Eckhardt et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Eckhardt2006" role="doc-biblioref">126</a>]</span> and Ehrlich et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Ehrlich1982" role="doc-biblioref">62</a>]</span> found no age-related changes using averages across individuals.
Bjornsson et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Bjornsson2008" role="doc-biblioref">127</a>]</span> also found that the intra-individual differences in differential methylation with ageing were highly heritable by use of familial clustering.
Work by Boks et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Boks2009" role="doc-biblioref">83</a>]</span> also using the golden gate array corroborated Bjornsson et al.’s findings in monozygotic twins.</p>
<p>The Bjornsson and Boks studies used the golden gate array on peripheral blood samples, whereas Christensen et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Christensen2009" role="doc-biblioref">128</a>]</span> used the golden gate array to look for age-related changes in DNAm in several tissue types.
CpG sites that are differentially methylated with age when searching across tissues were frequently specific to a small number of tissue types.
In addition, CpGs in CGIs tended to be hypermethylated with age and <em>vice versa</em>.
Christensen et al. also found that the methylation profiles for different tissues were highly predictive of tissue type.</p>
<p>Rakyan et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Rakyan2010" role="doc-biblioref">129</a>]</span> looked at age-related changes in DNAm using the Illumina 27k array <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Bibikova2009" role="doc-biblioref">130</a>]</span> with whole blood samples in a discovery set.
They replicated their findings in sorted cell fractions to see if they could capture changes in DNAm that could be attributed to changes in blood cell-type composition over time, which they did not find.
Teschendorff et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Teschendorff2010" role="doc-biblioref">131</a>]</span> found that promoters of targets of the polycomb group proteins (PCGTs) were more likely than non-PCGTs to become methylated with age <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Jung2015" role="doc-biblioref">132</a>]</span>.
Repression of PCGTs is required for Stem cells to differentiate.
PCGTs whose methylation status was associated with age were associated with pre-neoplastic conditions in a large cohort using the 27k array with blood and epithelial cell samples.</p>
<p>Whilst Bell et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Bell2010" role="doc-biblioref">133</a>]</span> observed a correlation between a major component of variation in DNA methylation in blood and age, Bocklandt et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Bocklandt2011" role="doc-biblioref">134</a>]</span> also using the 27k array but with saliva samples created the first “epigenetic clock” used to predict the chronological age of donors based on the DNAm landscape of their cells, the mean error was 5.2 years.
Bocklandt et al. were able to achieve similar predictive accuracy with as few as 3 CpG sites in their model.
Koch et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Koch2011" role="doc-biblioref">135</a>]</span> used publicly available 27k array datasets from a variety of different tissues to train a model using a different statistical method but only achieved an error of 11 years.
They did, however, identify a number of CpGs also identified by Bocklandt et al.
Bell et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Bell2012" role="doc-biblioref">136</a>]</span> used 27k array data to look for correlations between differential methylation and age-related phenotypes as well as chronological age.
They found that few age-related phenotypes were correlated with differential methylation, only 5 CpG sites were identified for the 16 age-related phenotypes examined. Whereas 490 significant CpGs were associated with chronological age.
Many of the CpGs they identified persisted across tissue types and replicated in a second cohort, several had been identified previously by Rakyan et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Rakyan2010" role="doc-biblioref">129</a>]</span> and Bocklandt et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Bocklandt2011" role="doc-biblioref">134</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Heyn et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Heyn2012" role="doc-biblioref">137</a>]</span> examined the DNA methylation status of a newborn and a centenarian in CD4+ T cells using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), along with a group of newborns and nonagenarians using the Illumina 450k array <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Bibikova2011" role="doc-biblioref">138</a>]</span>.
Heyn et al. observed a global decrease in methylation from newborn to centenarian, as well as an intermediate level of methylation on a sample of intermediate age (see figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:Heyn2012F1b">1.19</a>).
This observation was replicated in 450k data.
In addition, Heyn et al. noted that adjacent CpGs normally exhibit a substantial degree of correlation in methylation status and that they were less well correlated with their neighbours with increasing age.
Interestingly Jenkinson et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Jenkinson2017" role="doc-biblioref">95</a>]</span> found that correlation among nearby CpGs increased in cancer tissues.
Modelling work done by Affinito et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Affinito2016" role="doc-biblioref">139</a>]</span> agrees with this correlation between neighbouring CpGs under physiological conditions, which is particularly pronounced in CpG dense regions like CGIs.
The greater physical proximity of CpGs in CpG dense regions means that greater correlation is expected.
Due to the fact that these CpGs are more likely to be affected by the same proteins and regulatory features than CpGs with greater distance separating them <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Haerter2014" role="doc-biblioref">140</a>]</span>.
Garagnani et al. used 450k array data from a cohort of 64 subjects aged 9-83 to identify those CpGs most well correlated with age as had been done with previous array technologies <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Garagnani2012" role="doc-biblioref">141</a>]</span>.</p>

<p>In January of 2013 Hannum at al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Hannum2013" role="doc-biblioref">142</a>]</span> published a study using the Illumina 450k array and whole blood samples for 656 participants aged 19-101.
Their optimised model was able to predict age with an error of 3.9 years.
In December of the same year, Horvath <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Horvath2013" role="doc-biblioref">143</a>]</span> published a study using multiple datasets, including Hannum’s data, some produced on the 27k and some the 450k array.
Both used ‘elastic net’ penalised multivariate regression models to identify CpGs which collectively provide the best predictor of DNAm age rather than the CpGs which are individually most highly correlated with age <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Friedman2010" role="doc-biblioref">144</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Florath et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Florath2014" role="doc-biblioref">145</a>]</span> identified some additional age-associated CpGs from two large cohorts totalling N = 898 and an N = 67 8yr follow-up longitudinal cohort.
More than 3/4 of the CpG sites they identified began as hypomethylated and increased in methylation with age, a proportion likely skewed by the large number of 450k probes in CGIs and other typically low methylation regions.
Bacalini et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Bacalini2015" role="doc-biblioref">146</a>]</span> performed a meta-analysis of existing DNAm age datasets and employed a “region-centric” approach to try to identify loci larger than single CpGs which they anticipate will be more biologically meaningful than lone CpGs.
They found that their approach increased the number of common features identified using the Hannum et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Hannum2013" role="doc-biblioref">142</a>]</span> and Heyn et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Heyn2012" role="doc-biblioref">137</a>]</span> datasets.
Zaghlool et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Zaghlool2015" role="doc-biblioref">147</a>]</span> performed 450k array DNAm age study in Qatari population they identified 12/88, 23/490 and 102/162 of the CpGs found by Bocklandt et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Bocklandt2011" role="doc-biblioref">134</a>]</span>, Bell et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Bell2012" role="doc-biblioref">136</a>]</span> and Florath et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Florath2014" role="doc-biblioref">145</a>]</span> respectively. Zaghlool et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Zaghlool2015" role="doc-biblioref">147</a>]</span> also found that Horvath’s age predictor <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Horvath2013" role="doc-biblioref">143</a>]</span> had an error of 3.7 years in their dataset.
This is in agreement with existing findings and indicates that ethnicity has no major effects on the DNAm age signature. Benton et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Benton2017" role="doc-biblioref">148</a>]</span> looked at changes in DNA methylation with age in a genetically isolated population on Norfolk Island with similar results to previous studies but identifying some novel age-associated CpGs.</p>
<p>Most DNAm relationships with age noted in previous studies have been linear, Johnson et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Johnson2017" role="doc-biblioref">149</a>]</span> used the 450k array in peripheral blood samples.
They identified 21 CpGs whose DNAm changes at a rate that changes with age from an initial pool of 27,723 CpGs which were differentially methylated with age.
Two sites exhibited an increasing rate of increase in DNAm with age, and 18 sites a decreasing rate of increase.</p>

<div id="genetic-influences-on-dna-methylation" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.2</span> Genetic Influences on DNA Methylation</h3>
<p>Epigenetic variation falls on a continuum of genetic influence that can be summarised by three categories:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>pure</strong> - DNA sequence has no predictive value for epigenetic state.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>facilitated</strong> - DNA sequence biases the epigenetic state enabling epigenetic variation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>obligatory</strong> - DNA sequence permits exact prediction of epigenetic state.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Regional methylation state is strongly influenced by genotype, by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Smith2014a" role="doc-biblioref">150</a>]</span> and by structural variants <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Bell2017a" role="doc-biblioref">87</a>]</span>.
An example of an obligatory effect on methylation is a point mutation at a CpG site, a C to T transition precludes methylation at that site in future.
The effect of structural variants on methylation can be hard to determine as changes in sequence dosage often lead to measurement artefacts.
Efforts have been made to correct for the influence of genetic factors in EWAS, when searching for purely epigenetic effects but the potential interaction of the somatic mutations known to accumulate with age (Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:Jaiswal2014fig1">1.20</a>) and the changes in DNAm with age remain largely unexplored.
This is of particular relevance to DNAm as the profile of the types of mutation which accumulate with age (Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:Jaiswal2014fig2c">1.21</a>) distinctly favours C to T transition mutations which can disrupt CpG dinucleotides <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Jaiswal2014c" role="doc-biblioref">151</a>]</span>.
CpG dinucleaotides are particularly prone to these mutations through the deamination of 5mC to T.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.3</span> DNAm Age as a Biomarker of Ageing</h3>
<p>We have seen that DNAm can be a fairly accurate predictor of age, however, there is more to being a good biomarker of ageing than predictive accuracy.
Weidner et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Weidner2014" role="doc-biblioref">152</a>]</span> conducted a study with the specific intent of identifying CpG sites that would serve as the best biomarkers of ageing.
Below is a list of specific criteria for a high-quality biomarker of ageing laid out by Johnson et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Johnson2006" role="doc-biblioref">153</a>]</span>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It must predict the rate of ageing. In other words, it would tell exactly where a person is in their total lifespan. It must be a better predictor of lifespan than chronological age.</li>
<li>It must monitor a basic process that underlies the ageing process, not the effects of disease.</li>
<li>It must be able to be tested repeatedly without harming the person. For example, a blood test or an imaging technique.</li>
<li>It must be something that works in humans and laboratory animals, such as mice. This is so that it can be tested in lab animals before being validated in humans.</li>
</ol>
<p>We have seen that DNA methylation clocks can be good predictors of chronological age, we will revisit the question of whether or not they are superior to chronological age in their ability to predict lifespan below.
Bell et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Bell2012" role="doc-biblioref">136</a>]</span> found DNAm did not generally correlate well with ageing phenotypes but did correlate well with chronological age and Teschendorff et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Teschendorff2010" role="doc-biblioref">131</a>]</span> found that their age-associated DNAm signature remained fairly constant across several disease states including ovarian cancer and type 1 diabetes.
Suggesting that DNAm age prediction does indeed: “monitor a basic process that underlies the ageing process, not the effects of disease”, meeting criterion number 2.
Several of the DNAm clocks discussed so far have been based on whole peripheral blood samples meeting criterion number 3. DNAm age clocks have been shown to work in Chimpanzees <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Horvath2013" role="doc-biblioref">143</a>]</span>, Dogs/Wolves <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Thompson2017" role="doc-biblioref">154</a>]</span>, Mice <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Stubbs2017" role="doc-biblioref">155</a>]</span>, Naked Mole Rats <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Lowe2020" role="doc-biblioref">156</a>]</span>, Rhesus Macaques, Humpback Whales <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Lowe2018" role="doc-biblioref">157</a>]</span> and are likely to work in other mammalian model organisms.
Furthermore, a cross-species clock based on conserved ribosomal RNA genes has been developed <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Wang2019" role="doc-biblioref">158</a>]</span>.
It should be noted that Horvath’s Human clock uses array data and that the Dog/Wolf and Mouse clocks use RRBS.
Model organisms such as <em>C. elegans</em> which essentially lack DNA methylation would not, however, be likely to be tractable for DNAm based age prediction.
Consequently DNAm age prediction at least partially meets criterion number 4.</p>
<p>Is DNA methylation a better predictor of lifespan than chronological age?
Both Hannum and Horvath identified the difference between DNAm age and chronological age or <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{Age}\)</span> as a potential indicator of disproportionate biological ageing.
Marioni et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Marioni2015" role="doc-biblioref">159</a>]</span> explicitly set forth to test the value of DNAm age as a predictor of mortality.
Adjusting for age, sex, childhood IQ, education, social class, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and <em>APOE</em> e4 status a <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{Age}\)</span> of +5yr is associated with a 16% increased mortality risk (See figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:Marioni2015f3">1.22</a>).

A meta-analysis of DNAm age predictors by Chen et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Chen2016a" role="doc-biblioref">161</a>]</span> also found that measures of age acceleration based on Hannum and Horvath clocks were superior predictors of mortality than chronological age before and after correction for various potentially confounding factors.
Chen et al. also noted that correction for blood cell composition improved predictive power.
Indicating that DNAm age is indeed superior to chronological age as a predictor of lifespan meeting criterion number 1 for an ageing biomarker.</p>
<p>A new DNAm age clock explicitly designed to capture phenotypic age and outperform age acceleration as a biomarker of ageing has recently been produced by Levine et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Levine2018" role="doc-biblioref">162</a>]</span>.
The ‘PhenoAge’ metric was created by selecting nine biomarkers of ageing from 42 possible metrics using a proportional hazards penalised regression model and combining these with chronological age.
(The nine biomarkers are: Albumin, Creatinine, Serum glucose, C-reactive protein, Lymphocyte per cent, Mean red cell volume, Red cell distribution width, Alkaline phosphatase, White blood cell count.)
DNAm data was then regressed against PhenoAge using elastic-net regression to produce a DNAm based PhenoAge predictor which made use of 513 CpGs.
The PhenoAge predictor outperformed the Horvath and Hannum clocks at predicting all-cause mortality, comorbidities, coronary heart disease risk, and measures of physical functioning.
41 of the 513 CpGs in the PhenoAge clock were present in the original 353 CpG sites used in the Horvath clock.</p>
<p>The ‘GrimAge’ clock <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Lu2019" role="doc-biblioref">163</a>]</span> takes a different approach to previous epigenetic clocks in that it has a 2-tiered model predicting first seven surrogates for a variety of other biomarkers of ageing then fitting a model to predict time to death using these surrogates.
‘GrimAge’ outperforms age accelerations from the Horvath, Hannum and PhenoAge clocks at predicting time to death. Belsky et al. developed a DNA methylation based estimate of the rate of biological ageing called ‘DunedinPoAm’ <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Belsky2020" role="doc-biblioref">164</a>]</span>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.4</span> Discussion and Analysis of the Findings of DNAm Age Studies</h3>
<p>Interestingly CpGs whose methylation status has been identified as correlating with age in various studies show relatively little overlap. Despite this, changes in DNAm with age are probably the most robust and reproducible large-scale epigenetic change yet captured.
This lack of agreement in absolute terms, however, presents a challenge about how to interpret DNAm changes with age.</p>
<p>The result of the various DNAm age studies display some seemingly contradictory trends.
For example, there is the global loss of methylation with age <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Wilson1987" role="doc-biblioref">116</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Fraga2005" role="doc-biblioref">123</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Heyn2012" role="doc-biblioref">137</a>]</span> and yet the majority of the highly significant age predicting CpGs in clocks are undergoing hypermethylation by a ratio of very roughly 2:1 <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Rakyan2010" role="doc-biblioref">129</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Bocklandt2011" role="doc-biblioref">134</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Koch2011" role="doc-biblioref">135</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Garagnani2012" role="doc-biblioref">141</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Florath2014" role="doc-biblioref">145</a>]</span> (see figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:Florath2014F4abc">1.23</a>).
Interestingly when expanded to look at all age-associated CpGs and not just the most highly correlated CpGs a slightly different picture emerges. Teschendorff et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Teschendorff2010" role="doc-biblioref">131</a>]</span> noted in their original study and Zhang et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Zhang2017" role="doc-biblioref">165</a>]</span> noted in a subsequent analysis if more loosely age correlated sites are included hypomethylation with age is more prevalent.
Zhang et al. state roughly 60% of sites are hypomethylated and 40% hypermethylated, they also observed that all of the highly age-predictive CpGs which overlapped between the studies they examined were hypomethylated.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the technologies used to measure the DNAm introduce their own biases into global changes in DNAm levels.
The more Global measures such as WGBS and biochemical measures seem to favour hypomethylation with age <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Wilson1987" role="doc-biblioref">116</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Fraga2005" role="doc-biblioref">123</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Heyn2012" role="doc-biblioref">137</a>]</span>.
The arrays seem to have agreed more with these global measures as they have increased in size.
RRBS also seems to skew in favour of hypermethylation with age <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Cole2017" role="doc-biblioref">117</a>]</span>.
These more narrow technologies are biased towards promoters and CGIs with their higher CpG density and lower baseline methylation levels making the prior probability of observing a methylation event greater than demethylation by dint of having a dearth of methylated sites to start with.</p>
<p>Sites which are hypomethylated as their “ground state” are more likely to be in CGIs than sites which are hypermethylated as their “ground state”, and thus hypomethylated sites are more likely to be variable in their methylation state and subject to tight regulatory control than are hypermethylated sites.
Expanding the pool to look at CpG sites more poorly correlated with age is likely to introduce more sites whose hypomethylation with age is due to increased stochasticity with age.
However, from the background information, one would expect that hypermethylated sites in CpG dense regions like CGIs whose methylation level declines with age would make good quality indicators.
Given that CpGs in CGIs have a high prior probability of being hypomethylated, it follows that one would be more likely to observe a hypermethylation event by chance.
Consequently, a CpG in a CGI that exhibits hypomethylation with age is less likely to be a result of noise than its converse, this may explain the higher reproducibility of these hypomethylated sites.</p>

<p>In a review of DNAm and ageing Jones et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Jones2015" role="doc-biblioref">166</a>]</span> drew a distinction between epigenetic drift changes and epigenetic clock changes with age wherein they defined drift as “the collection of DNA methylation changes that are associated with age within an individual but are not common across individuals.”, which is slightly different from the definition used by Fraga et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Fraga2005" role="doc-biblioref">123</a>]</span>.
Clock changes are defined as “those sites that are associated with age across individuals and can thus in some cases be used to predict chronological age”.
Drift constitutes stochastic change over time not driven by some process which strongly biases the resulting changes in DNAm in direction or to specific sites.
Clock changes are the converse, some underlying process biases DNAm changes in direction and/or position.</p>
<p>This picture is complicated by the tissue specificity of DNAm changes.
Whilst it is evidently the case that multi-tissue DNAm age prediction is possible, it also seems to be the case that an age predictor trained on samples from a specific tissue will outperform one trained on multiple or other tissues when predicting the age of a sample of matching tissue type.
This is supported by the out-performance of the Horvath predictor by the Hannum predictor in blood samples <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Marioni2015" role="doc-biblioref">159</a>]</span> and differentially predicted ages of tissues such as breast noted by Horvath <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Horvath2013" role="doc-biblioref">143</a>]</span>.
DNAm was highly correlated with age for a variety of tissue-specific sites in many studies, suggesting that the definition of clock sites is frequently tissue-dependent.
This may also be true of drift changes, stochastic changes may occur at sites in one tissue that would be tightly controlled in another.
If one was interested in universal signatures of ageing common across cell-types, one could restrict the definition of clock changes further to only those which are present in all/most tissue types to make a multi-tissue predictor.</p>
<p>Apparent changes in the DNAm state of a mixed cell population could be due not to global changes in that population but rather its composition, blood exhibits changes in the cellular composition with age <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Rimmele2014" role="doc-biblioref">167</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Izzo2020" role="doc-biblioref">168</a>]</span>.
As haematopoietic stem cells age their numbers increase and their regenerative potential declines.
Their output becomes skewed towards the myeloid lineage but produces poorer quality cells.
The number of naive T-cells decreases with age, memory and effector T-cells accumulate as to memory B cells limiting the diversity in the cell-types and contributing to immunosenescence <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Geiger2013" role="doc-biblioref">169</a>]</span>.
Cellular composition of tissues can have a substantial impact on epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), especially when dealing with small effect sizes <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Jaffe2014" role="doc-biblioref">170</a>]</span>.
Thus shifts in cell composition such as those in blood during ageing can be substantial sources of confounding when searching for cell-intrinsic changes in DNA.
Some attempts to assay and/or correct for cell-type composition have been made, for example, Rakyan et al <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Rakyan2010" role="doc-biblioref">129</a>]</span> isolated <span class="math inline">\(CD4^+\)</span> T-cells and found that they had a 60% overlap with age-related CpGs in whole blood. Chen et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Chen2016a" role="doc-biblioref">161</a>]</span> used the method developed by Houseman et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Houseman2012" role="doc-biblioref">171</a>]</span> to correct for cell-type composition and found that it did improve the performance of the Horvath and Hannum age predictors.
The changes were significant but the effect of this correction was relatively modest.
Whilst cell composition has an effect, DNAm Age definitely seems to be capturing something beyond shifts in cell-type composition.
However, the age acceleration computed with Hannum’s method, which is trained on blood data only, was more strongly correlated with cell-type composition than Horvath’s method, indicating that extrinsic changes in cell-type composition likely have some impact the model.</p>
<p>Jenkinson et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Jenkinson2017" role="doc-biblioref">95</a>]</span> took an information-theoretic approach to DNA methylation maintenance, modelling the binary methylation state of CpGs as a noisy communications channel.
Permitting them to compute the information capacity (CAP), methylation entropy (ENT), and the relative dissipated energy (RDE) of these channels.
High capacity channels represent reliable transmission of methylation state, consistent with high RDE as more energy is needed to ensure reliability and low entropy as methylation is more ordered at sites under tighter control than at less highly controlled sites.
They found that the Transcription Start Sites (TSS) exhibited high levels of RDE and high information capacity as well as low levels of entropy.
These values trended in the opposite direction as they moved outwards to CGIs, shores and seas.
This information-theoretic framing provides a useful lens through which to view drift and clock loci.</p>
<p>It could be hypothesised that as a cell differentiates those sites the methylation status of which are most important for successful differentiation will be the focus of the expenditure of cellular resources to set and maintain their methylation state, and will thus exhibit high capacity and low entropy.
Whatever mechanism is focusing the resources of the cell on the maintenance of the methylation at these sites may be responsible for the tissue-specific biases in DNAm changes over time i.e. their targets will be clock sites.
Those sites not involved in the maintenance of the specific differentiated state would be a lower priority for the expenditure of cellular resources and thus display lower information capacity and higher entropy i.e. be drift sites.
This would also lead one to predict that multi-tissue age predicting loci would be enriched for factors common to the maintenance of a differentiated state.
The polycomb and Trithorax group proteins are very broadly evolutionarily conserved and play a key role in developmental cell fate choice and particularly in long-term stable maintenance of epigenetic state <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Schuettengruber2017" role="doc-biblioref">172</a>]</span>.
Consistent with this hypothesis Teschendorff et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Teschendorff2010" role="doc-biblioref">131</a>]</span> observed that PCGTs are enriched among CpGs associated with age and Levine et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Levine2018" role="doc-biblioref">162</a>]</span> also noted that their 513 clock CpGs were enriched for PCGTs.
This is also complementary to the idea that DNAm dysregulation with age promotes carcinogenesis by stabilising stem cell character but with reduced capacity for differentiation as proposed by Teschendorff et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Teschendorff2010" role="doc-biblioref">131</a>]</span> and Rakyan et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Rakyan2010" role="doc-biblioref">129</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>In his paper <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Horvath2013" role="doc-biblioref">143</a>]</span> Horvath proposed that DNAm age is a measure of the work done by an “Epigenetic Maintenance System” (EMS) which maintains epigenetic stability over time.
Considering work in its physical sense of the integral of power over time, Horvath considered power, the rate of change in the use of energy by the EMS as the ‘tick-rate’ of the epigenetic clock.
He proposed that during development power would be high due to the high level of stress on the system and that power would drop to a consistent level once maturity was reached.
Horvath laid out four predictions of this EMS model and argued that there was evidence in support of each of them. The predictions were:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Cancer tissue should show signs of accelerated age, reflecting the protective actions of the EMS</li>
<li>Many mitogens, genomic aberrations, and oncogenes, which trigger the response of the EMS, should be associated with accelerated DNAm age.</li>
<li>High age acceleration of cancer tissue should be associated with fewer somatic mutations given the protective role of the EMS</li>
<li>Mutations in TP53 should be associated with a lower age acceleration of cancer tissue if one further assumes that p53 signalling helps trigger the EMS</li>
</ol>
<p>A fifth prediction of this model would be that DNA methylation fidelity should be elevated during development and differentiation as a reflection of the greater amount of work done by the EMS during this period.
This is borne out by the results of Zhao et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Zhao2014" role="doc-biblioref">96</a>]</span> who noted a global increase in DNA methylation fidelity during the early differentiation of mouse embryonic stems cells (see figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:Zhao2014fig3ab">1.16</a>).</p>
<p>If Horvath’s concept of an EMS is accurate and Jenkinson et al.’s RDE captures the energy expended by the cell on the maintenance of the methylation state of a locus, one would expect Horvath’s concept of an EMS to tie in quite nicely with Jenkinson et al.’s methylation channel model.
With the Relative dissipated energy (RDE) for a CpG channel corresponding to the work done by Horvath’s EMS at a given locus.
Jenkinson et al. did indeed observe high levels of RDE in stem cells and a decline of RDE with age.
Interestingly, however, some cancers exhibited decreased RDE, CAP and increased entropy which is consistent with an accelerated ageing profile but seemingly less so with elevated activity of an EMS.
It is possible that whilst the distribution of RDE at various loci in the genome shifts giving a lower mean RDE that the total amount of energy expended is increasing but becoming less well targeted such that whilst there is increased energy flux through the EMS it is not being properly directed.
There may also be a plateau effect wherein the energy flux through the EMS is maxed out and cannot keep up with demand from many loci.
One would also predict more rapid equilibration of DNAm levels at loci with high RDEs, which could be examined by looking at the second derivatives for the stochastic model of DNA methylation described by Pfeifer et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Pfeifer1990a" role="doc-biblioref">93</a>]</span> using the experimental systems Laird et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Laird2004" role="doc-biblioref">92</a>]</span> and Riggs et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Riggs2004a" role="doc-biblioref">94</a>]</span> used which supported the original model.</p>
<p>Jenkinson et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Jenkinson2017" role="doc-biblioref">95</a>]</span> found a global increase in entropy with age, but not with cell passage in culture suggesting an increase in entropy is associated with epigenetic age independent of mitotic age.
This observation is in agreement with the finding that epigenetic state becomes more stochastic and diverges with age <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Fraga2005" role="doc-biblioref">123</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Slieker2016" role="doc-biblioref">124</a>]</span>, indeed genes whose methylation were most divergent with age were enriched for ageing associations.
They also observed a loss of entropic sensitivity with age.
Entropic sensitivity is an indicator of how plastic DNAm state is to extrinsic effects.
Jenkinson et al. noted that there is a general loss of phenotypic plasticity with age, but cited no specific instance of loss of DNAm plasticity to environmental effects with age.
Hahn et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Hahn2017" role="doc-biblioref">173</a>]</span> provided a possible example of this effect when they reported that dietary restriction caused fewer differences in the methylation state of older than younger mice.</p>
<p>In summary, DNAm age is a high-quality biomarker of ageing which can be tailored to the particular requirements of the context, be it estimating the chronological age of individuals, measuring age acceleration/deceleration of individuals relative to their chronological age or estimating age disparity of tissues <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Horvath2018" role="doc-biblioref">174</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Bell2019" role="doc-biblioref">175</a>]</span>.
There is predictably a cost/accuracy trade-off.
DNAm age is to some degree capturing “biological age” and likely not being driven by changes due to specific ageing-related diseases as illustrated by lack of relationships with specific pathologies and phenotypes of ageing noted by Bell et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Bell2012" role="doc-biblioref">136</a>]</span>.
The PhenoAge clock is a better predictor of morbidity and mortality than age acceleration but may not be a better predictor of underlying biological age if the risk it is capturing is driven more by disease than that captured by age acceleration.
PhenoAge is strongly associated with comorbidity count, more so than either the Hannun or Horvath clocks, interestingly zero comorbidities are associated with a negative PhenoAge score suggesting some of the PhenoAge signal is derived from disease status.
Disease may, of course, interact with biological age causing an acceleration thereof, making them difficult to disentangle.
Neither Age acceleration nor PhenoAge perfectly captures biological age but both are highly informative on the subject</p>
<p>Global DNA methylation decreases with age, DNA methylation becomes more disordered and less plastic to environmental influences with age.
A set of loci, not necessarily individual CpGs but rather some functional unit of methylation exhibit consistent predictable changes with age.
Which loci are in this set varies with tissue type; there is, however, a subset which seems to be common to most tissues.
The preponderance of these loci are in areas of high to moderate CpG density and become hypermethylated with age.
The high frequency of CpGs and the hypomethylated “ground state” of CGIs would lead one to expect a bias towards being located in CGIs and becoming hypermethylated.
Thus it is unclear if changes in DNA methylation over time are biased towards regions of high CpG density and hypermethylation at a level that is greater or less than one would predict with the prior information.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.6</span> Aims</h2>
<p>Going forward this work covers several aspects of change in DNA methylation related to ageing phenotypes.
Starting at the beginning of the human life-course with EWAS for <em>in utero</em> markers and interventions to impact on long-term bone health through the lens of the developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis.
Continuing with an examination of the age-related changes in the methylation state of a key functional region of the genome, whose methylation state has not previously been characterised in detail, namely the tRNA genes.
Lastly, the generation of new DNAm clocks based on a family of repetitive elements, specifically the Alu repeat family. Making use of another region of the genome the DNAm state of which has not previously been characterised in detail, but which represents a substantial proportion of all CpG sites and the derepression of which has long been considered to play a role in ageing.</p>
