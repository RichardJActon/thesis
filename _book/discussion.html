<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> <a href="arrays.html#arrays">Chapter 3</a> Epigenome Wide Association Studies for Bone Health Outcomes in Umbilical Cord Blood and Tissue</h2>
<p>In this chapter two CpGs were identified as having genome wide significant associations with the outcome of interest in their respective EWAS.
These CpGs were:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>CpG cg26559250 which is located at Chr6:157,653,445-157,653,447 at the ZDHHC14 (zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 14) gene.
This CpG was identified In the EWAS for total bone mineral content minus head at 6 years adjusted for age and sex, with a p-value of <span class="math inline">\(2.52\times 10^{-8}\)</span> for an increase of 1.46% per kg in an uncorrected model and a corrected model.</p></li>
<li><p>CpG cg22570676 located at Chr19:2,527,492-2,527,494 at the GNG7 (G protein subunit gamma 7) gene.
This CpG was identified on the EWAS for periosteal circumference at 38% from the distal end of the tibia at 6 years (mm) adjusted for age and sex, with a p-value of <span class="math inline">\(4.24\times 10^{-8}\)</span> for an increase of 0.370% per mm in an uncorrected model and a corrected model</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The corrected models included covariates for: Blood cell-type composition, Maternal Age at time of birth (years), Sex, maternal BMI at 11 weeks gestation, parity, whether or not the mother smoked during pregnancy, and gestational age.</p>
<p>EWAS were performed for 9 different outcomes across three groups of samples, and in each case four different models were fitted.
Within a given EWAS the quite stringent Bonerroni standard for multiple testing correction was applied, however conducting multiple EWAS across different groups creates a secondary multiple testing problem.
Meaning that these findings could still be false positives despite the aspiration of family wise correction to minimise type 1 errors.
Confirmation of these associations in another cohort would be preferable in order for the biological reality of these associations to be asserted with confidence.
These results are correlational and experimental follow up would be needed to establish any mechanistic or causal relationships between the DNA methylation state at these sites and bone properties in early life.
One could for example attempt epigenetic editing of orthologous sites in a model organism and look for an effect on bone measurements.</p>
<p>This study did not find significant correlations between the examined bone measurements at <em>CDKN2A</em>, where previously an inverse relationship between DNA methylation and bone size, mineral content and mineral density at 4 years had been documented <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Curtis2017" role="doc-biblioref">233</a>]</span>.
There was ample opportunity to see changes at this locus in the data, with 95 probe sites in the vicinity of this gene.
Nor did this study see significantly reduced DNA methylation at <em>RXRA</em> in umbilical cord with maternal vitamin D supplementation or increased circulating vitamin D at the 75 probe sites near <em>RXRA</em> <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Harvey2014d" role="doc-biblioref">232</a>]</span>.
Whilst this study did not replicate these specific findings it has highlighted two new loci with possible relationships to bone health outcomes.</p>
<p>Epigenome wide association studies are here being used as a discovery platform for processes which may be implicated in the interaction of the in eutero environment and bone health outcomes as mediated by the epigenome, all of which are complex and multifactorial.
There is not strong prior knowledge of the relationships between systems under investigation with which to make precise predictions, the aim is rather to provide a starting point for generating more specific models with which to generate more precise hypotheses.
This presents a challenge as there are many sources of noise which could obscure any relationships which do exist between these properties or produce the spurious appearance of a relationship when none may exist.
Striking the balance between sensitivity and specificity is particularly challenging in the context.
Lowering the threshold for specificity and admitting some type 1 errors might generate sufficient additional hits with which to attempt methods such as gene set enrichment analysis, and related approaches, to identify the biologically relevant systems and processes which may mediate the observed association.
However, an excessive number of false positive inputs to such analyses can lead to spuriously identifying associated terms.
Simply increasing the sample size of studies to reach the level of power necessary to detect small effect size changes is expensive, impractical and does not help when it comes to analysing existing datasets underpowered for the analysis as initially conceived.</p>
<p>If the primary interest is in identifying pathways or other functional biological units then making use of dimentionality reduction methods such as weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Langfelder2008" role="doc-biblioref">426</a>]</span> could potentially help to address some of the power issues faced by these studies.
Grouping the outcomes into effects on correlated gene networks rather than individual genes dramatically reduces the number of statistical tests performed.
This approach could be used to narrow the set of tests to perform when looking for gene level associations in other datasets.
If changes in gene networks are associated with an outcome of interest in one cohort it is reasonable to take this prior information to a second cohort and test only genes in this network for an association with the outcome of interest dramatically reducing the number of CpG level tests.
One could also perform the reciprocal analysis, (dimentionality reduction in the second cohort and CpG level tests on a reduced set on the first cohort), as a means of validation.
An ongoing collaboration with colleagues at MRC-IEU, University of Bristol is including this data in a meta-analysis and is replicating several of these EWAS in other cohorts.
This provides an opportunity to attempt to replicate the sites identified here and ascertain if they are sufficiently robust to warrant functional follow-up.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> <a href="tRNAs.html#tRNAs">Chapter 4</a> The Genomic Loci of Specific Human tRNA Genes Exhibit Ageing-Related DNA Hypermethylation</h2>
<p>The finding that the tRNAome is enriched for age related hypermethylation and that there are two loci in which this effect is distinct and replicable is challenging to interpret given the number of different regulatory paradigms in which tRNA genes are involved.
There are several ways in which the effects of changes on tRNA DNA methylation could manifest.
There is the canonical function of tRNAs in which changes would impact on the expression of the tRNA gene which alters the amount of mature tRNA produced, with potential consequences in translation.
There is also action through altering the amount or type of tRNA derived small RNA molecules produced.
There is altering the chromatin dynamics of the tRNA gene loci, with potential knock-on effects for other systems given their insulator activity <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Raab2011" role="doc-biblioref">319</a>]</span> and tendency to cluster in three dimensional space with other tRNA genes <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-VanBortle2017" role="doc-biblioref">320</a>]</span>.
In addition these are not mutually exclusive.
Given the relatively localised effects on DNA methylation that were observed (Figure <a href="tRNAs.html#fig:gvizLocusZooms">4.15</a>) the effect on larger scale chromatin dynamics would naively seem relatively unlikely by comparison with an effect on the transcription of the tRNA genes.
However, the effects of tRNA genes on genome architecture can apparently be mediated by local changes in the nucleosome organisation at tRNA genes <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Hamdani2019" role="doc-biblioref">427</a>]</span>, so it is hard to rule this out.
The circulating tRNA derived small RNAs have been documented as exhibiting age related changes and thus represent an additional signalling vector through which changes in tRNA expression could act <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Dhahbi2013" role="doc-biblioref">312</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Rounge2018" role="doc-biblioref">428</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>The effects of increased DNAm on tRNA genes was to repress their expression in a plasmid based experimental system <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Besser1990" role="doc-biblioref">286</a>]</span>, however this does not necessarily imply that increased DNA methylation at a tRNA gene locus would result in the reduced expression of tRNA derived small RNAs.
Changes in transcriptional dynamics may alter the fate of the transcription product in terms of fragmentation pattern or post transcriptional modifications just as changes in polII transcriptional dynamics impact alternative splicing in protein coding genes <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Tellier2020" role="doc-biblioref">429</a>]</span>.
It is plausible that increased DNA methylation at a tRNA gene could cause the tRNA gene to favour production of tRNA derived small RNA transcripts over canonical mature tRNAs rather than silencing it entirely.</p>
<p>tRNAs are a key component of the translation system, a core component of the cell, any age related alterations in this system have the potential to impact on essentially all other systems in the cell if they affect translation.
Translationâ€™s tight coupling to metabolic regulation and the effect of modulating it on ageing <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Hansen2007" role="doc-biblioref">310</a>]</span> means that any effect of tRNA gene DNAm on translation could be relevant for the regulation of ageing processes.</p>
<p>Unpicking the potential mechanism of action of action of changes in tRNA gene DNA methylation, if indeed these changes have physiologically relevant impacts, will require greater understanding of a number of aspects of tRNA biology.
Our collective understanding of the the post-transcriptional modifications of tRNAs and the regulatory functions of tRNA derived small RNAs is still in its infancy <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Schimmel2017" role="doc-biblioref">306</a>]</span>.
In conclusion are too many mechanisms of action through which changes in epigenetic state of tRNA genes could impact on ageing related systems and at present insufficient evidence to favour any one particular mechanism.
In addition, these possibilities are not mutually exclusive so any effects need not be limited to a single mechanism.</p>
<p>A number of age related tRNA DNA hypermethylation signals persisted after correction for cell-type composition, and there were some differences in tRNA gene DNA methylation between cell-types.
This suggests that there are at least some cell-type independent changes in tRNA DNA methylation and leaves open the possibility that there are some changes which are cell-type specific.
More detailed characterisation of the cell-type specific activities of tRNA genes may aid in the elucidation of the regulatory functions of tRNAs by permitting the association of the pathways active in particular cell-types.
The tRNA-iMet-CAT-1-4 locus which showed the most consistent result has an overall increase of 3.7% from age 4 years to age 78 years in targeted bisulfite sequencing data.
The 450k array and Targeted bisulfite sequencing results put the rate of increase in DNA methylation at tRNA-iMet-CAT-1-4 at somewhere in the approximate range of 0.05-0.22 percentage points of DNA methylation increase per year, starting with a baseline methylation near zero at birth.
CpGs differentially methylated with age have generally shown changes on the order of 0.1-0.125% per year <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Slieker2016" role="doc-biblioref">124</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Xu2014b" role="doc-biblioref">347</a>]</span>, placing the magnitude of the effect seen here in a comparable range to previously observed age related changes in DNA methylation.</p>
<p>The targeted bisulfite sequencing method employed here is quite efficient at capturing DNA methylation within tRNA genes as a single amplicon is generally sufficient to span a given tRNA gene.
This panel could be expanded to most of the human tRNAome though some loci have CpG loci positioned flanking the tRNA genes which prevent the design of primers spanning the tRNA gene locus.
It would be interesting to attempt this assay with enzymatic instead of bisulfite conversion as this might permit some inaccessible sites to be targeted with slightly longer amplicons and improve yields due the reduced fragmentation arising from bisulfite treatment <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Williams2019" role="doc-biblioref">109</a>]</span>.
If others wish to characterise DNA methylation at tRNA gene loci this method proved highly effective here.
It would be particularly interesting to employ this is mice at tRNA loci not well covered by RRBS, to see if the finding of tRNA gene enrichment for age related hypermethylation is also the case in mice.</p>
<p>An effective follow up experiment would be to use Pacific Biosciences no amplification CRISPR based targeted sequencing method to examine tRNA gene clusters <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Wieben2019" role="doc-biblioref">430</a>]</span>.
A dataset of this type has the potential to elucidate several features of the tRNA genes.
Firstly, it would permit a more detailed characterisation of tRNA gene copy number variation, at least those within known clusters, due to the long read sequencing technology.
Secondly, the ability to detect DNA methylation, and not simply average levels but patterns of methylation distribution within single molecules, which might reveal additional information about the nature of any age related changes <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Flusberg2010" role="doc-biblioref">431</a>]</span>.
The long sequencing reads would also permit unambiguous mapping to particular tRNA gene copies which would provide further evidence, in addition to that provided by the targeted bisulfite sequencing analysis, that the observed increase in DNA methylation with age is not somehow an artefact of mapping issues.
Coupled with this it would also be illuminating to employ the Hydro-tRNAseq and PAR-CLIP methods employed by Gogakos et al.Â <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Gogakos2017" role="doc-biblioref">318</a>]</span> to perform detailed characterisation of pre-tRNA and mature tRNA transcripts from the same system to permit the relationship between tRNA gene DNA methylation and tRNA transcription levels to be examined simultaneously.</p>
<p>Little was previously known about the epigenetic state of the human tRNA genes <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Bhargava2013a" role="doc-biblioref">313</a>]</span> and much remains to be characterised.
This work represents the first detailed characterisation of the DNA methylation state of the human tRNAome, and revealed a novel pattern of age related hypermethylation in these genes.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> <a href="Alus.html#Alus">Chapter 5</a> DNA methylation clocks in Alu Elements</h2>
<p>The best Alu DNA methylation age predictor constructed in this work was able to predict chronological age with an R of 0.65 from a training set of n=774 in an unrelated replication set of n=664 with a median absolute error of 8.1 years.
Whilst this is less accurate than many of the other DNA methylation based age predictors <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Bell2019" role="doc-biblioref">175</a>]</span> it was not the primary goal of this predictor to generate the most accurate age predictions but rather to be sufficiently accurate to capture a signature of age acceleration specific to the Alu repeat elements.
The difference between the predicted and chronological age, the age acceleration, was strongly correlated with the chronological age such that the age of older individuals is prone to be overestimated and vice versa.
One explanation for this may be down to the limitations of DNA methylation quantitation by MeDIP-seq.
The elastic net regression may have identified loci which have a consistent direction of change with age but are of variable magnitude.
If selecting for sites which had a relatively consistent magnitude in the training set but which varied in a manner which skews higher in the larger population this could lead to the overestimates of the age of older samples and the underestimates of the age of the younger ones.
This is speculative and it would be interesting to examine further by looking at the properties of the data in the training and prediction groups of the predictor sites and seeing how they are distributed.
In addition it may be possible to study this bias with a simulation approach to see what data properties can produce this pattern of error.
This effect in the quantile normalised data was not mitigated by binarising the data by locus, absolute methylation estimates, or in the raw reads per million base pairs data.
The difficulty with absolute DNA methylation quantitation by MeDIP-seq is not simple to resolve with common data transformations.</p>
<p>The strong association between Alu age acceleration and chronological age limited the interpretability of the GWAS for age acceleration.
This is because associations found here could easily be driven by differences in allele frequencies between different age strata within the GWAS population and not with signal driven by the Alu age acceleration independent of chronological age.</p>
<p>The samples used to train and test the models have a median age of approximately 60 years.
A larger proportion of samples at a particular part of the age distribution is also a potential source of bias, as poor performance in the lower numbers of older and younger individuals will not be penalised as much as poor performance at the ages with more samples.
Mitigating this by equalising the numbers in certain age groups is a possibility but a substantial number of samples must be left out to achieve this, excessively shrinking the training set.</p>
<p>The Twins UK dataset provides a powerful tool for assessing the impact of genetics on age predictors.
The age predictors generally performed only marginally better when predicting the ages of the twins of the individuals in the training set than on unrelated individuals, suggesting a minimal impact of genetic factors on the Alu DNA methylation age predictor.</p>
<p>Despite the issues with the correlation of age acceleration with chronological age this work and Wang et al.â€™s rDNA clock <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Wang2019" role="doc-biblioref">158</a>]</span> demonstrate that a DNA methylation based age predictors can be trained in repetitive sequence elements.
This suggests that constructing DNA methylation based age predictors targeted to particular subsets of the genome is possible.
Though, the aim of capturing signatures of biological ageing specific to those subsets is yet to be adequately explored.
It may be possible to revisit this approach once large whole genome bisulfite or the enzymatically converted equivalent datasets are generated as it seems unlikely that it would be economical to examine the ~1.1 mission Alu elements with any of the available targeted methods.
Other possible features on which to attempt to construct age predictors could include MIR repeat elements and Histone genes, though Histone genes present a relatively limited set of possible sites with which to predict.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.4</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>The unifying theme of this work is relationship between DNA methylation and healthy ageing.
From its possible function as a mediator for the effects of early life environmental influences on long term bone health, through age-related hypermethylation of genes encoding core components of the transcriptional machinery, to signatures of biological ageing in the repetitive regions of the genome.
The epigenome sits upon the genome encoding the annotations to the genome necessary for cells with diverse and dynamic functions to arise from a singular set of genetic information.
The ability to construct epigenetic clocks reveals that this layer of information storage and processing contains much that is important for understanding the processes of ageing.
The environmental malleability of the epigenome is its core strength, it is this plasticity to adopt multiple roles that permits multicellularity <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Tudge2016" role="doc-biblioref">432</a>]</span>.
The possibility of understanding the ageing related changes in the epigenome and of modulating those changes to increase longevity and healthspan make the epigenomics of ageing an important area for further study.</p>
