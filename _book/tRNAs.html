<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Abstract</h2>
<p>Understanding how the epigenome deteriorates with age and subsequently impacts on biological function may bring unique insights to ageing-related disease mechanisms. As a central cellular apparatus, tRNAs are fundamental to the information flow from DNA to proteins.
Whilst only being transcribed from ~46kb (&lt;0.002%) of the human genome, their transcripts are the second most abundant in the cell.
Furthermore, it is now increasingly recognised that tRNAs and their fragments also have complex regulatory functions.
In both their core translational and additional regulatory roles, tRNAs are intimately involved in the control of metabolic processes known to affect ageing.
Experimentally DNA methylation can alter tRNA expression, but little is known about the genomic DNA methylation state of tRNAs.</p>
<p>Here, we find that the human genomic tRNA loci are enriched for ageing-related DNA hypermethylation.
We initially identified DNA hypermethylation of 44 and 21 specific tRNA genes, at study-wide (p &lt; <span class="math inline">\(8.36\times10^{-5}\)</span>) and genome-wide (<span class="math inline">\(p &lt; 4.34\times10^{-9}\)</span>) significance, respectively, in 4,350 MeDIP-seq peripheral blood DNA methylomes (16 - 82 years).
This starkly contrasted with 0 hypomethylated at both these significance levels.
Further analysing the 21 genome-wide results, we found 3 of these tRNAs to be independent of major changes in cell-type composition (tRNA-iMet-CAT-1-4, tRNA-Ser-AGA-2-6, tRNA-Ile-AAT-4-1).
We also excluded the ageing-related changes being due to the inherent CpG density of the tRNAome by permutation analysis (1,000x, Empirical p-value &lt; <span class="math inline">\(1\times10^{-3}\)</span>).
We additionally explored 79 tRNA loci in an independent cohort using Fluidigm deep targeted bisulfite-sequencing of pooled DNA (n=190) across a range of 4 timepoints (aged ~4, ~28, ~63, ~78 years).
This revealed these ageing changes to be specific to particular isodecoder copies of these tRNAs (tRNAs coding for the same amino acid but with sequence body differences) and included replication of 2 of the 3 genome-wide tRNAs.
Additionally, this isodecoder-specificity may indicate the potential for regulatory fragment changes with age.</p>
<p>In this study we provide the first comprehensive evaluation at the genomic DNA methylation state of the human tRNAome, revealing a discreet and strongly directional hypermethylation with advancing age.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Ageing is implicated as a risk factor in multiple chronic diseases <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Partridge2018" role="doc-biblioref">288</a>]</span>.
Understanding how the ageing process leads to deteriorating biological function is now a major research focus. This field has hopes of increasing human longevity and â€˜healthspanâ€™ whilst ameliorating the extensive physical, social and economic costs of these ageing-related disorders <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Campisi2019" role="doc-biblioref">289</a>]</span>.
Epigenetic processes, which influence or inform cell-type specific gene expression, are altered with age and are a fundamental hallmark of this progression, indeed they are arguably a hub mediating other hallmarks including stem cell exhaustion, cellular senescence, and mitochondrial dysfunction <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Lopez-Otin2013" role="doc-biblioref">11</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Booth2016" role="doc-biblioref">30</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>DNA methylation (DNAm) is the most common epigenetic modification of DNA and age-associated changes in this mark were recognised in mammalian tissues as early as 1983 <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Wilson1983" role="doc-biblioref">138</a>]</span>.
Changes in DNAm with age are extensive with thousands of loci affected.
Many of these changes represent â€˜driftâ€™ <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Fraga2005" role="doc-biblioref">119</a>]</span> arising from the imperfect maintenance of methylation state.

The human tRNAome, comprising all of the genomic locations of tRNA genes, represents an extremely small portion of the genome <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Parisien2013" role="doc-biblioref">303</a>]</span>.
There are 416 high confidence tRNA genes when additionally considering tRNA pseudo genes, nuclear encoded mitochondrial tRNA genes and possibly some closely related repetitive sequences the number of sequences closely resembling tRNAs is 610 (gtRNAdb <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Chan2009" role="doc-biblioref">304</a>]</span>) this extended set covers &lt;46 kb (including introns) and represents &lt;0.002% of the human genome.
Despite their small genomic footprint, and the observation that approximately half of all tRNA genes are transcribed at negligible levels if at all <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Torres2019a" role="doc-biblioref">305</a>]</span>, these genes produce the second most abundant RNA species next to ribosomal RNA <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Lodish2000" role="doc-biblioref">306</a>]</span> and are required for the production of all proteins.
Mature tRNAs have an L-shaped three dimensional structure arising from a â€˜clover-leafâ€™ shaped two dimensional structure comprised of three hairpin stem-loop structures (Figure <a href="tRNAs.html#fig:tRNAstructure">4.1</a>).</p>

<p>tRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase III (polIII) <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Schramm2002" role="doc-biblioref">307</a>]</span> and have type II polIII promoters which contain A and B-box internal promoter elements bound by the complex TFIIIC, followed by TFIIIB, and polIII <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Canella2010" role="doc-biblioref">308</a>]</span> (Figure <a href="tRNAs.html#fig:tRNApromoter">4.2</a>).
Transcription is terminated by a simple run of Ts and proceeds in rounds of fast re-initiation where the same polIII molecule is preferentially re-used <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Dieci1996" role="doc-biblioref">309</a>]</span>.
tRNA gene expression is modulated by the polIII specific transcription factor Maf1 a highly conserved factor which represses tRNA transcription <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Murawski1994" role="doc-biblioref">310</a>â€“<a href="references.html#ref-Vorlander2020" role="doc-biblioref">312</a>]</span>.
The activity of Maf1 is modulated by the Target of Rapamycin Kinase Complex 1 (TORC1) <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Mange2017" role="doc-biblioref">313</a>]</span>, a highly conserved hub for signals that modulate ageing <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Kennedy2016" role="doc-biblioref">314</a>]</span>.
Several general transcription factors also influence tRNA gene expression; the tumour suppressors p53 <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Crighton2003" role="doc-biblioref">315</a>]</span> and Rb <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Sutcliffe2000" role="doc-biblioref">316</a>]</span> both negatively regulate tRNA expression and c-Myc upregulates tRNA gene expression, all act via TFIIIB <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Gomez-Roman2003" role="doc-biblioref">317</a>]</span>.
tRNAs are dysregulated in cancer, and have potential utility as prognostic markers <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Krishnan2016" role="doc-biblioref">318</a>]</span>.
tRNA regulation may play an important role in cancer <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Huang2018" role="doc-biblioref">319</a>]</span>.
DNAm is able to repress the expression of tRNA genes experimentally <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Besser1990" role="doc-biblioref">320</a>]</span>, in plasmid expression systems, but may also represent co-ordination with the local repressive chromatin state <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Varshney2015" role="doc-biblioref">321</a>]</span>.
In addition, recent results from Gerber et al.Â <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Gerber2020" role="doc-biblioref">322</a>]</span> show a mechanism by which polII can function in the regulation of certain polIII transcribed loci including several tRNA genes.</p>

<p>Assuming similar rates of transcription one would expect that the more frequently an amino acid is used in the exome, the more copies of that tRNA gene there would be in the genome <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Gingold2012" role="doc-biblioref">323</a>]</span>.
Indeed, tRNA gene dosage is quite closely matched to amino acid usage frequency in the human exome, though the correlation is less strong for codon usage (Figure <a href="tRNAs.html#fig:codonAndaaFreqNtRNAplots">4.3</a>).
The imperfect nature of this correlation suggests that there may be regulation of tRNA expression beyond simply having copy numbers proportionate to usage frequency.</p>

<p>A variety of observations have indicated that many tRNA genes are expressed in a tissue specific fashion in diverse organisms <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Dittmar2006" role="doc-biblioref">325</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Sagi2016" role="doc-biblioref">326</a>]</span>.
These include the tissue specific manifestations of diseases caused by mutations involving tRNAs and their usage <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Kirchner2017" role="doc-biblioref">327</a>]</span>,<span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Ishimura2015" role="doc-biblioref">328</a>]</span>.
Though detailed characterisation of tissue specific tRNA expression patterns are still lacking.
Considering the broad similarity of transcriptome codon usage across time and tissues and the purported functional equivalence in translation of tRNAs with the same anticodon, there is an open question as to the reason for tissue specificity of tRNA expression.
The tissue specific expression of tRNAs whilst substantially maintaining codon ratios would require highly coordinated tRNA gene regulation to obtain similar expression levels of putatively functionally equivalent genes. This situation is strongly suggestive of as yet undiscovered function.</p>
<p>Additionally, beyond their core role in the information flow from DNA to protein sequence, tRNAs can fragment into numerous tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs).
There are a number of types of tRNA derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Pliatsika2018" role="doc-biblioref">329</a>]</span> which serve as signalling molecules <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Lee2009" role="doc-biblioref">330</a>]</span> (Figure <a href="tRNAs.html#fig:tRNAderivedSmallRNARoles">4.4</a>).
Four main types of tsRNAs have been identified, these are 5â€™ tRNA halves, 3â€™ tRNA halves, and the tRNA derived fragments (tRFs) of ~18 - ~22bp sizes <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Torres2019" role="doc-biblioref">331</a>â€“<a href="references.html#ref-Xu2017a" role="doc-biblioref">333</a>]</span>.
tRNAs and pre-tRNAs also give rise to piRNAs <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Keam2014" role="doc-biblioref">334</a>â€“<a href="references.html#ref-Tosar2018" role="doc-biblioref">336</a>]</span> and internal tRNA fragments or itRFs <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Loher2017" role="doc-biblioref">337</a>]</span>.
The terminology and ontology of tsRNAs is still stabilising as our understanding of these RNA species evolves.
Some of these tsRNAs feedback on protein synthesis by regulating ribosome biogenesis <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Kim2017" role="doc-biblioref">338</a>]</span>, others have diverse regulatory functions such as targeting transposable element transcripts <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Martinez2017" role="doc-biblioref">339</a>]</span>.
The extent of the functional significance of tsRNAs is also an open question <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Schimmel2017" role="doc-biblioref">340</a>]</span>.</p>

<p>Ageing is linked to core aspects of metabolic regulation, with nutrient sensing and stress response acting as major modulators of ageing.
tRNAs as well as tsRNAs are integral to the regulation of protein synthesis and stress response.
Protein synthesis represents a substantial proportion of total cellular energy expenditure and this fraction can vary considerably with nutrient availability <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Pace2006" role="doc-biblioref">342</a>]</span>.
Metabolic processes are also recognised to modulate the age estimates of DNAm clocks <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Nwanaji-Enwerem2018" role="doc-biblioref">343</a>]</span>.
Partial inhibition of translation increases lifespan in multiple model organisms <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Hansen2007" role="doc-biblioref">344</a>]</span> and polIII inhibition increases longevity acting downstream of TORC1 <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Filer2017" role="doc-biblioref">345</a>]</span>.
Furthermore, 5â€™ tRNA halves circulating in serum are modulated by ageing and caloric restriction <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Dhahbi2013" role="doc-biblioref">346</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>DNAm is able to repress the expression of tRNA genes on methylated expression vectors <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Besser1990" role="doc-biblioref">320</a>]</span>.
Whilst the broader chromatin milieu affects tRNA transcription, tRNA genes are unusual in that they are sufficiently short to fit within a single nucleosome.
tRNA genes are generally â€˜nucleosome freeâ€™ and precise placement of the nucleosome immediately upstream of the transcriptional start site is of importance for their expression <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Bhargava2013a" role="doc-biblioref">347</a>]</span>.
A recent review of the epigenetic regulation of the polIII transcriptome <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Park2017" role="doc-biblioref">348</a>]</span> noted the very limited CpG methylation data available at polIII loci.
Transcription by RNA polymerase III at SINE loci is suppressed by histone methylation but not by DNA methylation <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Varshney2015" role="doc-biblioref">321</a>]</span>, indicating that DNA methylation may not directly influence the expression of tRNA genes but may do so by influencing the surrounding chromatin state.
Standard RNA-seq is of limited utility in examining tRNA expression due to the issues of mappability, in addition much RNA-seq data is generated with size and polyA selection methods which would exclude tRNA derived transcripts.
Also, tRNAs are a major target for â€˜epitranscriptomicâ€™ modification, with an average of 11-13 modifications per tRNA <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Schimmel2017" role="doc-biblioref">340</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Wilusz2015" role="doc-biblioref">349</a>]</span>, some of which stop polymerases from elongating or alter base pairing, creating further mapping challenges.
Thus, variants on standard RNA-seq procedures have been developed <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Cozen2015" role="doc-biblioref">350</a>â€“<a href="references.html#ref-Gogakos2017" role="doc-biblioref">352</a>]</span>.
polIII ChIP-seq has been used as a proxy for tRNA gene expression and, unlike RNA-seq based methods, generates reads from uniquely identifiable flanking regions which map to a known locus of origin <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Canella2010" role="doc-biblioref">308</a>]</span>.
This same advantage exists for the MeDIP-seq data used in this study.</p>
<p>tRNA gene loci may also play a role in large scale genome organisation.
tRNA gene clusters act as insulators <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Raab2011" role="doc-biblioref">353</a>]</span>, and have extensive long-range chromatin interactions with other tRNA gene loci <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-VanBortle2017" role="doc-biblioref">354</a>]</span>.
The coordinated transcription of tRNAs at subnuclear foci may represent an organising principle for 3D-chromatin by providing spatial constraints.
In both budding and fission yeast tRNA genes localise to the nucleolus.
In fission yeast, a subset of B-box sequence elements are bound by TFIIIC and not polIII serving as chromatin anchors to the nuclear periphery and acting as boundaries between euchromatic and heterochromatic regions <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Noma2006" role="doc-biblioref">355</a>]</span>.
It is unclear to what extent tRNA genes may play similar roles in large scale chromatin organisation in other organisms.</p>
<p>In this study ageing-related changes in the epigenetic DNA methylation state of the entire tRNAome were directly investigated, facilitated by the availability of a large-scale MeDIP-seq dataset.
Arrays poorly cover this portion of genome.
The 450k and EPIC arrays have 110 robust probes covering 84 tRNAs and 129 robust probes covering 89 tRNAs respectively, thus even the latest EPIC arrays cover &lt;15% of the tRNA genes, with robust probes, and in total only ~4.7% of all the tRNA gene CpGs <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Zhou2017" role="doc-biblioref">223</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>tRNA genes sit at the heart not only of the core biological process of translation but at a nexus of signalling networks operating in several different paradigms, from small RNA signalling to large scale chromatin organisation <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-VanBortle2017" role="doc-biblioref">354</a>]</span>.
In summation tRNA biology, protein synthesis, nutrient sensing, stress response and ageing are intimately interlinked.
The newly described ageing-related observation of tRNAome DNA hypermethylation has here been identified as and independently replicated.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.3.3.2</span> Analysis of DNA methylome data for Significant Ageing-related changes</h4>
<p>All analysis was performed in R/3.5.2.
Linear models were fitted to age using the MeDIP-seq DNA methylome data, as quantile normalised RPM scores at each 500bp window.
Quantile normalisation was performed with the <code>qqnorm</code> R function with the theoretical quantiles of the RPM values at each window used in subsequent analysis.</p>
<p>Models were fitted with:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>No covariates</li>
<li>Batch information as a fixed effect</li>
<li>Blood cell-type counts for neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, and lymphocytes as fixed effects</li>
<li>Batch and Blood Cell counts as fixed effects</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Models 1 &amp; 2 were fitted on the full set of 4350 as batch information was available for all samples but blood cell count data was only available for a subset of 3001 methylomes.</li>
<li>Models 1 &amp; 2 fitted in the n=3001 subset were similar to those fitted in the complete set of 4350.</li>
<li>Models 3 &amp; 4 were fitted in the n=3001 subset with full covariate information and sets of significant tRNAs identified at study-wide and genome wide levels in model 4 were used in subsequent analyses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Models were also fitted for two unrelated subsets created by selecting one twin from each pair (Monozygotic or Dizygotic), yielding sets with n = 1198 &amp; 1206 DNA methylomes.
One additional model was fitted for longitudinal analysis, samples were selected by identifying individuals with a DNA methylome at more than one time point and filtering for only those with a minimum of 5 years between samples.
This yielded 658 methylomes from 329 individuals with age differences of 5-16.1 years, median 7.6 years.
Models for this set included participant identifier as a fixed effect in addition to blood cell counts and batch information.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.3.3.3</span> Permutation Analysis for Enrichment with Age-related Changes</h4>
<p>Permutation analysis was performed to determine whether the CpG distribution of sets of the tRNAome was the principle driver of the ageing-related changes observed.
Windows overlapping tRNAs have a higher proportion of windows with a greater CpG density than their surrounding sequences (see Figure <a href="tRNAs.html#fig:CpGcountBGvstRNAPlot">4.6</a>).
CpGs residing within moderate CpG density loci are the most dynamic in the genome <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Ziller2013" role="doc-biblioref">86</a>]</span> and CpG dense CpG island regions include specific ageing-related changes <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Rakyan2010" role="doc-biblioref">153</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Teschendorff2010" role="doc-biblioref">155</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Bell2016" role="doc-biblioref">209</a>]</span>.
For comparison the permutation was also performed in the CGI regions from the Polycomb group protein target promoters in Teschendorff <em>et al.</em> <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Teschendorff2010" role="doc-biblioref">155</a>]</span> and bivalent loci from ENCODE ChromHMM â€˜Poised Promoterâ€™ classification in the GM12878 cell-line <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Ernst2011" role="doc-biblioref">359</a>]</span>.
A random set of 500bp windows representing an equivalent CpG density distribution of the feature set in question were selected from the genome-wide data.
Above a certain CpG density there are insufficient windows to sample without replacement within a permutation.
Furthermore, above ~<span class="math inline">\(\ge18\%\)</span> CpG density CpG Islands become increasingly likely to hypomethylated <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Bell2012a" role="doc-biblioref">360</a>]</span>.
Therefore, all windows with a CpG density of <span class="math inline">\(\ge18\%\)</span> (45 CpGs per 500bp) were grouped and sampled from the same pool.
i.e.Â a window overlapping a tRNA gene which had a 20% density could be represented in permutation by one with any density <span class="math inline">\(\ge18\%\)</span>.
This permutation was performed 1,000 times to determine an Empirical p value by calculating the number of times the permutation result exceeded the observed number of significant windows in the feature set.
<span class="math inline">\(Empirical~p-value = \frac{r+1}{N+1}\)</span>, where r is the sum of significantly hypermethylating windows in all permutations and N is number of permutations <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-North2003" role="doc-biblioref">361</a>]</span>.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.3.3.6</span> Targeted Bisulfite Sequencing</h4>
<p>tRNA loci were selected for targeted sequencing which exhibited changes and DNAm with age along with closely related tRNAs in which changes were not observed.
Primer design was performed using â€˜methPrimerâ€™ <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Li2002" role="doc-biblioref">237</a>]</span> (<a href="./Supplementary_Files/Targeted_BiS-seq_Primers.txt">Supplementary File S2</a>).
A total of 84 tRNA loci were targeted in 2 rounds of sequencing, 79 subsequently generated reliable results post-QC.
The targeted tRNAs covered a total of 723 CpGs with a median of 8 CpGs per tRNA (range 1-13), data passing QC was generated for 458 CpGs, median 6 (range 1-9) per tRNA.</p>
<p>Initial QC for readcount, base call quality and base composition was caried out with <a href="https://github.com/s-andrews/FastQC"><code>FastQC</code></a> <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Andrews2010" role="doc-biblioref">229</a>]</span> and <a href="https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC"><code>multiqc</code></a> <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Ewels2016" role="doc-biblioref">362</a>]</span> for combined visualisation of QC outputs.
Quality based trimming was performed with <a href="https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore"><code>Trim Galore</code></a> <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Krueger2015" role="doc-biblioref">363</a>]</span> and target specific primer trimming with <a href="https://github.com/marcelm/cutadapt"><code>cutadapt</code></a> <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Martin2011" role="doc-biblioref">364</a>]</span> and custom <code>perl 5</code> scripts.
Alignment and methylation calling was performed with <code>Bismark</code> (v0.20.0) <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Krueger2011" role="doc-biblioref">236</a>]</span> making use of <code>bowtie2</code> <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Langmead2012" role="doc-biblioref">365</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>The alignment was performed against both the whole hg19 genome and just the tRNAome +/- 100bp to assess the possible impact of off-target mapping.
Mapping to the whole genome did produce purported methylation calls at a larger number of loci than mapping just to the tRNAome (683,783 vs 45,861 respectively).
Introducing a minimum coverage threshold of 25 reads dramatically reduced this and brought the number of sites into line with that in the tRNAome set (36,065 vs 33,664 respectively) suggesting a small number of ambiguously mapping reads.
All subsequent analysis was performed using the alignment to just the tRNAome with a minimum coverage of 25 reads.</p>
<p>Pairwise differential methylation analysis of the tRNA genes at the different time points was performed using <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/RnBeads.html"><code>RnBeads</code></a> <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Muller2019" role="doc-biblioref">366</a>]</span> with <code>limma</code> <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Ritchie2015" role="doc-biblioref">367</a>]</span> and a minimum coverage of 25 reads.
Linear regression was used to predict age from DNA methylation at the targeted tRNA sites, permitting us to compare rates of increase with age.
For the linear regression, only CpG sites with more than 25 reads mapped to the regions of the genome targeted for amplification were used.</p>

<p>Due to the small size of these tRNAs (60-86bp, median 73bp, excluding introns which are present in ~30 tRNAs with sizes from 10-99bp, median 19bp), this fragment-based method enabled a robust examination of the epigenetic state of these highly similar sequences.
This was supported by a mappability assessment.
The median mappability score density for the tRNAome was 0.90 for 50mers when considering tRNA genes <span class="math inline">\(\pm500bp\)</span> reflecting the regional nature of the MeDIP-seq assay <a href="tRNAs.html#mappabilityDensity">Methods</a> <a href="tRNAs.html#mappabilityDensity">4.3.2.2</a>.
In contrast the 50mer mappability density is 0.68 for the tRNA gene sequences alone without flanking sequences.
Excluding the flanking region is representative of the mappability of reads generated using a technique such as whole-genome bisulfite sequencing.
This is because there is no IP fragment so reads mapping to adjacent more mappable sequences do not convey information about the methylation state of sites in the same fragment but to which it is harder to map (see Figures <a href="tRNAs.html#fig:mappabilityiMet1">4.10</a> &amp; <a href="tRNAs.html#fig:mappabilityScoreDensity">4.11</a>).</p>

Study-wide significance was calculated conservatively using the Bonferroni method for all 598 autosomal tRNAs.
There was a strong directional trend with all results at both significance levels being due to increases in DNA methylation.

<p>Due to the related nature of these twin samples, these data were also analysed in two subsets of n=1198 &amp; 1206 by selecting one twin from each pair into the separate sets.
This analysis also included correction for Batch and Blood Cell counts.
Whilst in these smaller datasets no tRNAs were genome-wide significant, 5 and 7 tRNA genes, respectively, reached study-wide significance, with consistent hypermethylation.
In these sets 5/5 and 6/7 of these were present in 16 study-wide significant tRNA genes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a subset of samples with longitudinal data were examined (n=658 methylomes from 329 individuals, median age difference 7.6 yrs).
At the nominal significance threshold (p &lt; 0.05) this yielded a split of 41 hypermethylating tRNA genes and 22 hypomethylating tRNA genes.
Of these hypermethylated tRNAs, 2 are in the previously identified genome-wide significant set of 3 (with tRNA-iMet-CAT-1-4 ranked 3rd by p-value) and 9 are in the study-wide significant set of 16.</p>

To assess whether this hypermethylation finding was being driven merely by the inherent CpG density of the tRNAome, a CpG density matched permutation analysis was performed (1,000X, see <a href="tRNAs.html#AgeErichmentPermutation">Methods</a> <a href="tRNAs.html#AgeErichmentPermutation">4.3.3.3</a>).

<p>tRNA-iMet-CAT-1-4 is located in the largest tRNA gene cluster in the human genome at chr6p22.2-1 (<a href="tRNAs.html#clustering">Methods</a> <a href="tRNAs.html#clustering">4.3.2.1</a>).
This cluster contains 157 tRNA genes spanning the 2.67Mb from tRNA-iMet-CAT-1-2 to tRNA-Leu-AAG-3-1, and also hosts a histone gene microcluster.
tRNA-Ile-AAT-4-1 and tRNA-Ser-AGA-2-6 are neighbours and are located on chromosome 17 (Figure <a href="tRNAs.html#fig:gvizLocusZooms">4.15</a>).
Notably tRNA-Ile-AAT-4-1 and tRNA-Ser-AGA-2-6 have a third close neighbour tRNA-Thr-AGT-1-2 which does not show significant age-related hypermethylation.
A similar pattern of sharp peaks of significance closely localised around the other loci was observed in the study-wide significant set.
GENCODE 19 places tRNA-Ile-AAT-4-1 in the 3â€™UTR of a Nonsense-mediated decay transcript of <em>CTC1</em> (CST Telomere Replication Complex Component 1, CTC1-002, ENST00000449476.2) and not of its primary transcript.</p>

<p>To place these hypermethylating tRNA genes in their genomic context the clustering for the extended set of 44 non-blood cell-type corrected study-wide significant tRNAs was examined.
The tRNA genes were clustered by grouping together all tRNAs within 5Mb of one another and then required that a cluster contain at least 5 tRNA genes with a density of at least 5 tRNA genes per Mb (see <a href="tRNAs.html#clustering">Methods</a> <a href="tRNAs.html#clustering">4.3.2.1</a>).
This yielded 12 major tRNA gene clusters containing a total of 353 tRNA genes, 42 of the 44 study-wide significant tRNA genes in the non cell-type corrected age model reside within these clusters (figure <a href="tRNAs.html#fig:heyn">4.16</a> a).

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.4.2.2</span> Age-related tRNAome DNA Hypermethylation is even observed in one Newborn versus one Centenarian</h4>
<p>Whole genome bisulfite data was sought out for two reasons:
1) The greater positional resolution of WGBS permits one to check if the age-related hypermethylation could be seen at CpGs located within the tRNA genes themselves.
2) As DNA methylation levels are estimated based on the ratio of methylated to unmethylated reads using WGBS, seeing an increased DNA methylation with age is not likely to be due to a copy number expansion or differential read distribution with age which could confound the MeDIP-seq signal.
An available Whole Genome Bisulphite sequencing (WGBS) dataset from Heyn <em>et al.</em> <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Heyn2012" role="doc-biblioref">161</a>]</span> was examined (see <a href="tRNAs.html#tRNAmethods">Methods</a> <a href="tRNAs.html#tRNAmethods">4.3</a>).
These data consisted of blood-derived DNA WGBS in one newborn child and one 26 year old, and centenarian (103 years).
In their analysis, the centenarian was found to have more hypomethylated CpGs than the neonate across all genomic compartments, including promoters, exonic, intronic, and intergenic regions.
However, even in this examination of 3 individuals of 3 different ages in the 55% of tRNA genes that possessed coverage, DNA hypermethylation with age was observed among the study-wide significant hypermethylating tRNA genes.
The centenarian was significantly more methylated in this set of tRNAs than the neonate (Wilcoxon rank sum test, 6.14% increase (95% CI -Inf - 4.31), W = 717, p = <span class="math inline">\(6.14\times10^{-4}\)</span>, see Figure <a href="tRNAs.html#fig:heyn">4.16</a> b).</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.4.2.3</span> Age-related Changes Independently Replicated with Targeted Bisulfite Sequencing</h4>
<p>In order to further robustly support these-ageing related changes, an attempt was made to replicate these findings in an independent ageing dataset.
Furthermore, a different technology was employed, Targeted bisulfite (BiS) sequencing, to further validate the MeDIP-seq-derived results.
These data provide individual CpG resolution to identify what may be driving the regional DNAm changes observed.</p>
<p>This targeted BiS-seq was performed in blood-derived DNA from 8 pools of age-matched individuals at 4 time-points (~4, ~28, ~63, ~78 years) from a total of 190 individuals, as detailed in Table <a href="tRNAs.html#fig:poolSummaryTable">4.7</a>.
A total of 79 tRNA loci generated reliable results post-QC (see <a href="tRNAs.html#targetedBiSseq">Methods</a> <a href="tRNAs.html#targetedBiSseq">4.3.3.6</a>).
These tRNAs covered a total of 458 CpGs with a median of 6 CpGs per tRNA (range 1-9).
Median Coverage per site across pools, technical replicates and batches was 679 reads (mean 5902).</p>
<p>Firstly, the 8 Pooled samples were run on the Illumina EPIC (850k) array to confirm that this pooling approach was applicable for DNAm ageing-related evaluation.
This showed an <span class="math inline">\(R^2 = 0.98\)</span> between pool mean chronological age and Horvath clock DNAm predicted age <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Horvath2013" role="doc-biblioref">168</a>]</span>(see Figure <a href="tRNAs.html#fig:DNAmAgeVsChronAge">4.17</a>).
This approach permitted the assay tRNA gene DNA methylation across a large number of individuals whilst requiring a minimal amount of DNA from each individual (80-100ng), and costing ~1/24th as much as performing sequencing individually.
Therefore, this confirmed the utility of this novel pooling approach.
These DNA methylation array derived data were also used to estimate the major blood cell proportions for each of these pools with the Houseman algorithm <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Houseman2012" role="doc-biblioref">272</a>]</span>.</p>

<p>It was observed that individual tRNA loci exhibiting age-related changes in DNAm had duplicate or isodecoder (same anticodon but body sequence variation) sequences in the genome, which despite exact or near sequence identity did not show similar changes.
tRNA-iMet-CAT-1-4 for instance is 1 of 8 identical copies in the genome and was the only locus that showed significant changes.
The results of pairwise differential methylation tests between age groups for the 6 top tRNAs from the MeDIP-seq models are listed in Table <a href="tRNAs.html#fig:pairwiseTab">4.19</a>.</p>
<p>Of the 3 top hits in MeDIP-seq, tRNA-iMet-CAT-1-4 (Figure <a href="tRNAs.html#fig:combinedKaryoplots">4.20</a>c) and tRNA-Ser-AGA-2-6 (Figure <a href="tRNAs.html#fig:combinedKaryoplots">4.20</a>i) exceeded nominal significance (p-values = <span class="math inline">\(9.35\times10^{-4}\)</span> &amp; <span class="math inline">\(4.28\times10^{-2}\)</span> , respectively).
tRNA-Leu-TAG-2-1 from the study-wide significant set also showed nominally significant hypermethylation with age (Figure <a href="tRNAs.html#fig:combinedKaryoplots">4.20</a>u).
Also, four of the individual CpGs in tRNA-iMet-CAT-1-4 exhibited nominally significant increases in DNAm with Age (Figure <a href="tRNAs.html#fig:tRNAiMetCAT1x4nomSigCpG">4.18</a>).
However, tRNA-Ile-AAT-4-1 (Figure <a href="tRNAs.html#fig:combinedKaryoplots">4.20</a>n) showed a nominal decrease in DNAm with age.</p>

<p>Three tRNA genes remained genome-wide significant and 16 study-wide significant following correction for major cell-type fraction.
This is suggestive of either cell-type independent change or, presumably less likely, a very large effect in a minor cell-type fraction.
tRNAs have exhibited tissue-specific expression <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Dittmar2006" role="doc-biblioref">325</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Sagi2016" role="doc-biblioref">326</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Schmitt2014b" role="doc-biblioref">378</a>]</span> and blood cell-type populations change with age.
Specifically, there is shift to favour the production of cells in the myeloid lineage <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Geiger2013" role="doc-biblioref">377</a>]</span>.
These points lead us to examine tRNA gene DNAm in sorted cell populations.
A publicly available 450k array dataset <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Reinius2012" role="doc-biblioref">369</a>]</span>) that has been used in the construction of cell-type specific DNAm references for cell-type fraction prediction using the Houseman algorithm <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Houseman2012" role="doc-biblioref">272</a>]</span> was used (see <a href="tRNAs.html#sortedbloodmethods">Methods</a> <a href="tRNAs.html#sortedbloodmethods">4.3.5</a>).
This consists of data from 6 individuals (aged <span class="math inline">\(38 \pm 13.6\)</span>/yrs) from seven isolated cell populations (CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD56+ NK cells, CD19+ B cells, CD14+ monocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils).
It was found that tRNA gene DNAm could separate myeloid from lymphoid lineages (Figures <a href="tRNAs.html#fig:meanMethbytRNAMatLowBB6">4.23</a> &amp; <a href="tRNAs.html#fig:meanMethbytRNAMatHeatmapLow">4.24</a>).</p>
<p>Of the eight study-wide significant tRNAs with array coverage, it was identified that collectively these eight are significantly more methylated in the lymphoid than the myeloid lineage (1.1% difference, Wilcoxon rank sum test p = <span class="math inline">\(1.50\times10^{-6}\)</span> 95% CI 0.7%-<span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>).
Thus, any age related increases in myeloid cell proportion would be expected to dampen rather than exaggerate the observed age-related hypermethylation signal.
In addition tRNA-Ile-AAT-4-1 and tRNA-Ser-AGA-2-6 have the highest variance in their DNAm of all 129 tRNAs covered in this dataset.
This could represent ageing-related changes as these samples range across almost 3 decades.
Another possibility may be that these loci as well as hypermethylating are also increasing their variability with age in a similar fashion to those identified by Slieker <em>et al.</em> <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Slieker2016" role="doc-biblioref">120</a>]</span>.
In that study they identified that those loci accruing methylomic variability were associated with fundamental ageing mechanisms.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.4</span> Expression of tRNAs in Blood with Age</h3>
<p>Having observed specific tRNA gene isodecoders hypermethylating with age it followed that the expression of tsRNA in blood cell-types would be worth exploring to ascertain if the expression levels of such transcripts declined as DNA methylation levels of the loci which encode them increase.
A bioinformatic approach was devised to attempt to assay tRNA transcription in order to use standard publicly available small RNA-seq datasets.
A customised MINTmap <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Loher2017" role="doc-biblioref">337</a>]</span> reference was designed to include only fragments which unambiguously map to a single tRNA gene locus and which overlap the 5â€™ or 3â€™ end of the genomic tRNA sequence by at least one base with no mismatches.
This reference is intended to capture pre-tRNAs prior to processing and CCA addition operating under the assumption that the levels of pre-tRNAs will be informative about the amount of transcription taking place at the tRNA loci (see <a href="tRNAs.html#mintmapmethods">Methods</a> <a href="tRNAs.html#mintmapmethods">4.3.7</a>).
This custom MINTmap reference build yielded 383 fragments mapping to 92 distinct tRNA loci in this data.
The lack of coverage of age hypermethylating tRNAs by uniquely attributable RNA-seq reads prevented us from drawing any strong conclusions about the relationship between DNAm changes and changes in tRNA transcription.</p>
<p>Using the original MINTmap reference optimised to detect tRNA fragments derived from mature tRNAs there were 5384 unique fragments derived from as many as 417 tRNA loci.
However, the mapping between fragments and loci in this reference is many to many, with each tRNA gene able to give rise to many fragments and each fragment attributable to at least 1 and usually many tRNA genes.
The examination of these fragments was limited to those with a length of greater than or equal to 40nt to capture reads more likely to be derived from mature tRNAs rather than tRFs or tRNA halves (Figure <a href="tRNAs.html#fig:combinedFragSizeDists">4.29</a>).
48 tsRNAs with nominally significant expression changes (p &lt; 0.05) were identified, 8 increased and 40 decreased in abundance with age.
For example 5 of 6 fragments showing significant age-related expression changes derived from the Gln-CTG family of tRNAs are decreasing with age (Figure <a href="tRNAs.html#fig:mintmapres">4.28</a>).
This is suggestive that expression of some tRNA genes may decline with age but this possibility is in need of additional tRNA expression data before it can be asserted with confidence.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.5</span> Mice also show age-related tRNA gene DNA hypermethylation</h3>
<p>To see if this age-related tRNA gene DNA hypermethylation was present in another mammal, the DNA methylation of the mouse tRNA genes was examined using data from a reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) experiment performed by Petkovich et al.Â <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Petkovich2017" role="doc-biblioref">375</a>]</span>.

<p>In order to investigate the mouse results further data from Thornlow et al.Â <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Thornlow2020" role="doc-biblioref">380</a>]</span>, which had established tRNA ortholog sets for 29 mammalian species, were used.
They identified 197 mouse tRNAs as having direct human orthologs with 44 of these included in the mouse results from Petkovich et al.Â <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Petkovich2017" role="doc-biblioref">375</a>]</span>.
However, unfortunately, although 2 of the top 3 tRNAs (tRNA-Ser-AGA-2-6 &amp; tRNA-Ile-AAT-4-1) have mouse orthologs (tRNA-Ser-AGA-2-2 &amp; tRNA-Ile-AAT-1-1), they are not covered in these mouse data.
Furthermore, none of the tRNAs showing significant hypermethylation in mice (at nominal p&lt;0.05) had human orthologs in our MeDIP-seq study-wide significant hypermethylating set.
Therefore, whilst specific tRNA loci cannot be directly compared due to this lack of coverage, it is interesting that the small number of significant tRNA genes in the mouse data also hypermethylate with age.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Discussion</h2>
<p>This work has identified a previously unknown enrichment for age-related epigenetic changes within the tRNA genes of the human genome.
This observation was strongly directional with increasing DNA methylation with age <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Ehrlich2019" role="doc-biblioref">381</a>]</span>.
The MeDIP-seq dataset employed brought advantages in exploring this undefined terrain of the tRNAome.
Firstly, being genome-wide it provides much increased access, as these regions are poorly covered by current arrays.
Secondly, being a fragment-based regional assessment of DNA methylation, the individual but highly similar small tRNA genes can be surrounded by unique sequence.</p>
<p>It was determined by genome-wide permutation that this strong hypermethylation signal was specific to the tRNAome, and not merely driven by the underlying CpG density of these loci.
A targeted BiS-seq experiment validated the defined nature of the tRNA change in an independent dataset, with a pooled sample approach, which may also be useful for other ageing-related targeted DNA methylome evaluations.
Additionally, support was gained for these results from limited DNA methylation array data.</p>
<p>Whilst the changes in DNA methylation observed here are relatively small (i.e.Â 3.7% between 4-year to 78-year pools in tRNA-iMet-CAT-1-4), this is consistent with the effect size seen in the majority of positions differentially methylated with age in many other studies <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Slieker2016" role="doc-biblioref">120</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Xu2014b" role="doc-biblioref">382</a>]</span>, except for the noted extreme outliers, such as <em>EVOLV2</em> <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Slieker2018" role="doc-biblioref">383</a>]</span>.
Furthermore, effect size cut-offs have distinct limitations, they do not generalise well between studies and they have been observed to remove a large fraction of true age-DMPs <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Zhu2018" role="doc-biblioref">384</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Additional exploration of what was driving this age-related phenomenon and its possible biological implications was undertaken.
This result was observed in DNA from peripheral blood, a source with a heterogeneous cell-type population <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Lappalainen2017" role="doc-biblioref">225</a>]</span>.
Moreover, there are well known age-related proportional changes in peripheral blood cell composition <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Geiger2013" role="doc-biblioref">377</a>]</span>.
The TwinsUK MeDIP-seq and 450k array DNA methylation data included measured haematological values.
Therefore, major cell type effects such as a myeloid skew were adjusted for, and distinct tRNAs were still significant.
Although, a caveat to this is that one cannot exclude changes in minor specific sub-cell fraction types.
However, that these age-related effects were strong enough to be observed in both a regional MeDIP-seq assessment, DNA methylation arrays with minimal coverage of the tRNA genes, and a pooled sequencing approach, implies that they not extremely subtle.
Age-related tRNA gene DNA methylation changes were observed in the limited subset of mouse tRNA genes covered in publicly available RRBS data (~13%) and were able to identify tRNAs exhibiting DNA hypermethylation with age in this set.
This suggests that age-related tRNA gene hypermethylation may not be unique to humans, and may extend at least across mammals.</p>
<p>The high number of hypermethylating tRNAs prior to cell-type correction pointed to the possibility that the epigenetic state of this small tRNAome fraction of genome could capture cell-type.
tRNA gene DNA methylation was found to be capable of separating myeloid from lymphoid lineages.
There also was some suggestion of more fine-grained blood cell-type signatures in tRNA DNAm, such as the separation of CD19+ B cells from CD4/8+ T cells.
Ageing is also known to lead to an increase in senescent cells (<em>e.g.</em> CD8+ CD28- cells).
Whether these epigenetic changes in the tRNAome uniquely represent these cell-types will require technical advances to enable future single cell DNA methylome analysis to accurately assess these regions.
If further supported, the epigenetic state of these loci may aid the taxonomy of cell-type definition.</p>
<p>This signal within the tRNA families was observed to occur at specific Isodecoders.
After correcting for major cell types, two tRNA genes, tRNA-iMet-CAT-1-4 and tRNA-Ser-AGA-2-6, were identified which had the most consistent hypermethylation across 3 different assays.
Isodecoders expand in number with organismal complexity and the high prevalence in mammals has been suggested to be due to their additional regulatory functionality <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Keam2014" role="doc-biblioref">334</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Goodenbour2006" role="doc-biblioref">385</a>]</span>.
They also have distinct translational efficiency <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Geslain2010" role="doc-biblioref">386</a>]</span>, which can also have consequences in human disease <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Kirchner2017" role="doc-biblioref">327</a>]</span>.
Furthermore, there is great complexity to the fragmentation of tRNA <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Schimmel2017" role="doc-biblioref">340</a>]</span>, with physiological processes such as stress shown to induce fragment production <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Li2019" role="doc-biblioref">387</a>]</span>.
These resultant tsRNAs can feedback on protein synthesis by regulating ribosome biogenesis <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Kim2017" role="doc-biblioref">338</a>]</span> and others have diverse regulatory functions such as targeting transposable element transcripts <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Martinez2017" role="doc-biblioref">339</a>]</span>.
They are also observed to circulate in the blood in a cell-free fashion, and fragment levels can be modulated by ageing and calorie restriction <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Dhahbi2013" role="doc-biblioref">346</a>]</span>.
The isodecoder specific nature of our findings frame a possible hypothesis for regulatory change with age and future work will be required to unravel this potential.</p>
<p>There was an inconsistent result for tRNA-Ile-AAT-4-1, it is covered by a MeDIP-seq 500bp window which exhibited genome-wide significant hypermethylation, but also partially overlaps tRNA-Ser-AGA-2-6 (Figure 3B).
Whilst the 450k array probe overlapping tRNA-Ile-AAT-4-1 (cg06382303) appears to replicate this hypermethylation, it is a borderline case for exclusion flagged by Zhou et al.Â <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Zhou2017" role="doc-biblioref">223</a>]</span> due to non-unique 30bp 3â€™ subsequence.
In the targeted Bisulfite sequencing data, tRNA-Ile-AAT-4-1 exhibited a loss of methylation.
Therefore, this may suggest that the hypermethylation signal observed at this locus in the MeDIP-seq data could have been â€˜pulled upâ€™ by the neighbouring tRNA-Ser-AGA-2-6 hypermethylation signal.
Of the 16 study-wide significant tRNA genes, only these two have a shared significant window, furthermore, in the expanded set of 44 only tRNA-Thr-AGT-1-2 could be similarly affected.</p>
<p>Codon usage frequencies have been claimed to be mostly invariant in the transcriptomes of a wide range of tissues, as well as across developmental time <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Schmitt2014b" role="doc-biblioref">378</a>]</span>, Although, others have found the majority of isodecoders are transcribed in different cell types <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Parisien2013" role="doc-biblioref">303</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>However, differences in the codon usage of genes with highly tissue-specific expression patterns have been observed <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Plotkin2004" role="doc-biblioref">388</a>]</span>.
Transcriptome codon usage frequency and corresponding tRNA gene expression levels have been claimed to vary with several other factors; notably, the replicative state of cells, as well as across developmental time <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Schmitt2014" role="doc-biblioref">389</a>]</span>.
Experimental stress-related states have revealed changes with an over-representation of codons that are translated by rare tRNAs <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Gingold2012" role="doc-biblioref">323</a>]</span>.
Differences in the codon usage of genes with highly tissue-specifically expressed genes have been observed <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Powell1997" role="doc-biblioref">390</a>]</span>.
It has however been argued that these differences are substantially explained by variation in GC content <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Rudolph2016" role="doc-biblioref">391</a>]</span>, and the extent to which codon usage plays a role in regulation of translation remains contested.
Changes in the epigenetic state of specific tRNAs could be modulating transcription efficiency or even codon availability in the ageing cell.
tRNA gene dosage is quite closely matched to amino acid usage frequency in the human exome.</p>
<p>The location of tRNA-Ser-AGA-2-6 and tRNA-Ile-AAT-4-1 immediately downstream of <em>CTC1</em> and of tRNA-Ile-AAT-4-1 within the 3â€™UTR of an alternate isoform of <em>CTC1</em>, which undergoes nonsense mediated decay raises the possibility that the gene body epigenetic regulation of <em>CTC1</em> may impact on the state of these tRNA genes.
<em>CTC1</em>â€™s function in telomere maintenance <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Gu2018" role="doc-biblioref">392</a>]</span>, DNA replication licensing <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Wang2019a" role="doc-biblioref">393</a>]</span>, and itâ€™s role in a rare progeroid condition <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Sargolzaeiaval2018" role="doc-biblioref">394</a>]</span> indicate that it has ageing-relevant biology. The possible relationship between the regulation of <em>CTC1</em> and that of the tRNA genes downstream of it warrants further study.</p>
<p>Several transcription factors acting via TFIIIB <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Gomez-Roman2003" role="doc-biblioref">317</a>]</span> have a negative (the tumour suppressors p53 <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Crighton2003" role="doc-biblioref">315</a>]</span> and Rb <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Sutcliffe2000" role="doc-biblioref">316</a>]</span>) or positive (the proto-oncogene c-Myc) influence <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Gomez-Roman2003" role="doc-biblioref">317</a>]</span>.
Regulatory sequence in the flanking or the internal regions of tRNA genes do not explain tRNA expression variation <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Schmitt2014" role="doc-biblioref">389</a>]</span>.
Whilst DNAm is able to repress the expression of tRNA genes <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Besser1990" role="doc-biblioref">320</a>]</span> in a plasmid expression system, the broader chromatin environment also affects tRNA transcription.
Due to the co-ordinated nature of epigenomic modifications, it may also be revealing to evaluate ageing-related histone modification in these tRNA loci.</p>
<p>tRNA sequences themselves are under strong structural (both secondary and tertiary) <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Goodenbour2006" role="doc-biblioref">385</a>]</span> as well as functional constraint, which leads to an order of magnitude reduction in variation compared the background genomic mutation rate <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Parisien2013" role="doc-biblioref">303</a>]</span>.
However, polymorphic tRNA could be another potential caveat to this work.
Although, there is no significant population variation in, for example, tRNA iMet sequences in 1,000 Genomes data.
Indeed, there are only 11 new isodecoder sequences with high confidence (tRNAscan scores <span class="math inline">\(\ge50\)</span>) at &gt;1% population frequency <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Parisien2013" role="doc-biblioref">303</a>]</span>.
Despite strong purifying selection maintaining very low variation in tRNA gene bodies, tRNA genes are subject to high levels of transcription-associated mutagenesis (TAM) leading to elevated mutation rates over evolutionary time in their immediate flanking sequences <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Thornlow2018" role="doc-biblioref">395</a>]</span>.
There is also some evidence for tRNA copy number variation at specific loci, although this remains under-characterised <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Iben2015" role="doc-biblioref">396</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Darrow2014" role="doc-biblioref">397</a>]</span>.
Another potential cause considered was whether age-related somatic copy number increases could be occurring in these loci.
Population or somatic copy number expansions could lead to increased methylated reads in MeDIP-seq without any epigenetic state change.
However, this would not be consistent with the targeted and array BiS conversion methodologies, where the proportion of methylated to unmethylated reads would still be constant.</p>
<p>It is worth noting the parallels with known cancer and ageing epigenetic changes, and that tRNAs are also dysregulated in cancer <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Huang2018" role="doc-biblioref">319</a>]</span>, with proposed utility as prognostic markers <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Krishnan2016" role="doc-biblioref">318</a>]</span>.
Furthermore, the early replicating state of tRNA loci, potentially associated with high expression <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Muller2017" role="doc-biblioref">398</a>]</span>, may make them prone to hypermethylate, as is observed in early replicating loci in both cancer <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Du2019" role="doc-biblioref">399</a>]</span> and senescent cells <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Cruickshanks2013" role="doc-biblioref">400</a>]</span>.
Interestingly, tRNA gene loci may also play a role in local as well as large scale genome organisation <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-VanBortle2017" role="doc-biblioref">354</a>]</span>.
tRNA gene clusters act as insulators <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Raab2011" role="doc-biblioref">353</a>]</span> and have extensive long-range chromatin interactions with other tRNA gene loci <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-VanBortle2017" role="doc-biblioref">354</a>]</span>.
The coordinated transcription of tRNAs at subnuclear foci and the B-box sequence elements bound by TFIIIC and not polIII may represent an organising principle for 3D-chromatin by providing spatial constraints <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Noma2006" role="doc-biblioref">355</a>]</span>.
Therefore, these tRNA epigenetic changes could contribute to the structural changes that are also observed in ageing <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Sun2018" role="doc-biblioref">401</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>A predominantly unmethylated state across fetal (Figure <a href="tRNAs.html#fig:meanMethBytRNAByFetalTissueHeatmap">4.26</a>) and adult tissues (Figure <a href="tRNAs.html#fig:meanBetasByTissueTNMHeatmap">4.25</a>) was observed at tRNA gene loci, consistent with the high rate of transcription at many tRNA gene loci.
We suspect that the tRNA genes largely remain unmethylated through development and that the moderate increases in DNAm that are observed with age at these loci are being driven by changes arising primarily in older individuals.
Distinct biological changes have been observed recently in aged individuals <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Moskowitz2017" role="doc-biblioref">402</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Hashimoto2019" role="doc-biblioref">403</a>]</span>.
This would also be consistent with the lack of significant differences in the tRNA loci detected between the neonate and the 26-year-old adult in the Heyn et al.Â <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Heyn2012" role="doc-biblioref">161</a>]</span> data.
This low baseline DNA methylation of the tRNA genes may also explain why the observed age related changes are predominantly hypermethylation.
Whether this is driven by mechanisms, such as aberrant DNA methylation targeting of the tRNA loci or specific sub-celltype effects with age, will require further experimental investigation.</p>
<p>The attempt to estimate tRNA transcription by identifying fragments which may be derived from pre-tRNA sequences has serious limitations.
It assumes that pre-tRNA levels reflect the amount of tRNA transcription, however, this may not be the case as pre-tRNAs are rapidly processed to mature tRNAs.
The requirement for a read length of at least 40nt only has only a limited ability to distinguish full length tRNAs from tRNA derived small-RNAs, and the short read length of the data prevented the use of a higher threshold.
Furthermore the limited number of reads unambiguously mapping to a specific tRNA locus limits the utility of this approach for inferring the effects of epigenetic changes at a specific locus on the expression at that locus.
tsRNA abundance has been associated with locus specific tRNA gene expression, in some cases independent of mature tRNA levels <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Torres2019" role="doc-biblioref">331</a>]</span>.
This has important implications for the interpretation of these results given the multi-copy nature of genes like tRNA-iMet-CAT-1-4, as even if expression levels of mature iMet tRNAs are unaffected by changes in one copyâ€™s DNA methylation, these changes could still influence the levels of particular tsRNAs derived from specific tRNA loci.
The implications of these changes in DNAm levels at tRNA genes for biological ageing warrant further exploration.</p>
<p>In conclusion, due to the unique challenges that make the tRNAome difficult to examine it has remained epigenetically under-characterised despite its critical importance for cell function.
This work directly interrogates the epigenetic DNA methylation state of the functionally important tRNAome, across the age spectrum in a range of datasets as well as methodologies and identified an enrichment for age-related DNA hypermethylation in the human tRNA genes.</p>
