I would like to acknowledge Nevena Krstic for her work extracting the DNA for the MAVIDOS EPIC array analysis and Dr Millie Parsons for her assistance with with the MAVIDOS sample metadata, as well as Dr Beth Curtis and Professor Nick Harvey of the MRC-LEU for their assistance with framing the research questions for the vitamin D and bone development outcomes work with the MAVIDOS samples.
The MRC-LEU is supported by the Medical Research Council (MRC).
I gratefully acknowledge the individuals from TwinsUK, Mavidos and the Hertfordshrie cohort.
I would like to acknowledge Nikki Graham for her assistance identifying suitable samples for targeted bisulfite sequencing work and her work extracting DNA from those samples. 
TwinsUK received funding from the Wellcome Trust (Ref: 081878/Z/06/Z), European Community’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013), the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)-funded BioResource, Clinical Research Facility and Biomedical Research Centre based at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust in partnership with King’s College London. 
Further funding support for the EpiTwin project was obtained from the European Research Council (project number 250157) and BGI. 
SNP Genotyping was performed by The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and National Eye Institute via NIH/CIDR.
