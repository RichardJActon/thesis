I would like to acknowledge Nevena Krstic for her work extracting the DNA for the MAVIDOS EPIC array analysis and Dr Millie Parsons for her assistance with with the MAVIDOS sample metadata, as well as Dr Beth Curtis and Professor Nick Harvey for their assistance with framing the research questions for the vitamin D and bone development outcomes work with the MAVIDOS samples. I would like to acknowledge Nikki Graham for her assistance identifying suitable samples for targeted bisulfite sequencing work and her work extracting DNA from those samples. I acknowledge the use of the IRIDIS High-Performance Computing Facility, and associated support services at the University of Southampton, in the completion of this work. Finally, I would like to acknowledge the extensive help and support of my primary supervisor Dr Chris Bell.
